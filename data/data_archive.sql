		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable" style=""><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>The latest update to the 3DS''s StreetPass Plaza came with four new games. I want to run and get as many play coins as possible to play them all.</p>


<p>They cost £4.49 each and it''s £13.49 if you buy them all in a one-time bundle that a rabbit with a tablet that he just bought offers you - like Nintendo are deliberately lampooning Apple. I want to hide the fact that there were initial troubles accessing the shop that would crash the console, and instead I want to tear down the walls of limitation that hold me inside Puzzle Swap and StreetPass Quest and expand one of my favourite features of what is rapidly shaping up to become one of my favourite ever consoles.</p>


<p>To start with, I want to reach out and touch the flames of the StreetPass Mansion. It''s a clever combination of Puzzle Swap and StreetPass Quest: your SP hits give you different shapes and colour pieces, which you use to turn into rooms and corridors of your mansion. In there there''s treasure chests, or ghosts, which you fight in real-time. It''s a neat little game - very good fun, and it''s a good upgrade from Quest.</p>


<p>After playing Mansion, I decided I wanted to feel the sunlight on my face and the dust clouds of the mansion disappear without a trace. So I delved into StreetPass Garden, developed by the team behind the Ocarina of Time 3D port. It''s the strangest of the new games and also the most difficult to get into. This isn''t because it''s bad, or because it''s boring, but simply because there are so many tutorials to get through and they''re staggered with every single hit. It takes forever to actually play the damn game. I just want to shelter my plants from the poison rain! Why are you making it so difficult!? Once you get through the tutorials, it''s a nice, relaxing little game.</p>

</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><p>In StreetPass Battle, we''re still building an army using our StreetPass hits, then burning down love in a Risk-style game. The coolest part about this game is that when you get a hit, that Mii is actually a general of a whole army of Miis - the population of your StreetPass plaza. So, if you were to pass myself, I have a population of around 600 - you''d get an additional 600 members for your army. From here, you invade other countries, and when I go there - to those other countries - I go there with you - and your StreetPass population. It''s all I can do. The battles are based on a rock-paper-scissors system, and it works, but it''s just a little too easy. I''ve only done three countries out of a possible twenty, though, so maybe it will get trickier as the game progresses.</p>

You''re a member of the StreetPass Squad, a team of international space police that go around battling pirates on various planets. The city''s aflood with pirates? StreetPass Squad. Our love turns to rust? StreetPass Squad. Your StreetPass hits are recruited into your squadron. They can then be added to as both lives and weapons, with colours representing what abilities those weapons have. So, together, we''re beaten and blown by the wind, trumpled in dust. But I''ll show you a place high on a desert plain, as the environments are varied and fun. It''s definitely the most expansive and probably the most enjoyable of all the new games.<br></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Big things. Impressive things. Terrible things.</p><p>Microsoft had revealed the Xbox One to tumultuous disapproval three weeks prior to gaming''s biggest conference. The stage was set to redeem themselves, to tell people, ''No, we''re not restricting your ownership of games, and no, we''re not going to force you to check in online every 24 hours.'' They had three solid weeks of incredibly negative feedback on the idea from every outlet - consumers, existing customers and the press alike - so even if the rumours were true, they had enough time and market research to backtrack. Instead, they fucked up. Bigtime.</p><p>In what must surely go down as one of the worst marketing disasters in history - certainly in gaming - the basic message from Microsoft is that they don''t care about their console anymore. They don’t care about consumers. I''m not entirely sure they care about making money. If they did, they would have listened to the fanbase and realised that they are making a console that absolutely nobody wants. I''ve never bought a Microsoft console and never considered the X1 in the first place, but even so, they''ve pushed me even further away.</p><p>The icing on the cake is when Don Mattrick turned around and basically said if you weren''t happy with it, not to buy it. Buy an Xbox 360 instead. Yeah, that''ll go down well. TELL ME NOT TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT. As if I needed any other reasons to.</p><p>The sole redeeming feature of the Xbox One is the approach to the Cloud. Always Online is not something that affects me at all, and the fact that MS wants to offset some of its processing load to its servers means that the Xbox One can continue to become more powerful - whereas the PS4, come the end of the generation, will be in a weaker position hardware wise.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p>Sony were also on thin ice. Much the same as MS, there was speculation that PS4 owners would not be able to trade in, sell or lend their games. Now, I don''t know if it was ever planned - and Sony, unlike Microsoft, just listened to their consumers - but their whole conference was a very obvious and deliberate middle finger to their American competitors. The console is a full £100 cheaper, always online is not necessary, their online service is cheaper and comes with more benefits, and then, of course, there was the most brilliantly pedantic parody of Microsoft''s ''instructions'' on how to share a used game (see right).</p>

</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>But ultimately what sells a console to me is games, and yet again, there is not one single Microsoft exclusive that appeals to me. Titanfall looks far too generic and I have no interest in it whatsoever. There are only a few on PS4 - Infamous: Second Sons, Gran Turismo, and Knack all look interesting, but that''s about it. It''s early days, though, and I''m sure that more will come.<br></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><center>

</center>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Nintendo took a relative backseat as the Wii U has already been out a while, but being brutally honest, although the Wii U console is an impressive piece of kit, it has very little in the way of software as of yet and as a result sales have been slow. This E3 was their chance to repeat what they did with the 3DS, and unleash a tirade of AAA-quality titles to immediately impact sales. Whilst they certainly did offer up some fantastic looking titles (not least of which being Super Smash Bros 4) all of them had a penned release date of 2014 and do nothing to sell the console to me now. I guess I''ll wait until Christmas.</span><br></p>

<p>In terms of multiplatform titles, Final Fantasy XV, Destiny and Metal Gear Solid V lead the way, and I''ll want a next-generation console for those titles alone.</p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>So back to the question this article poses: who won? Well, for me, it would be a tie between Sony and Nintendo with Sony probably just about edging it. The PS4 showed the goods, Nintendo showed the games, but they were both a little too short. In terms of who is going to win the next generation, Nintendo need to seriously step up their game to stand a realistic change of competing with Sony - but I''m not entirely sure they are anymore. Microsoft will lose, but not as badly as everyone''s expecting - they may have shunned a huge, huge portion of their market but there''s still the teen CODders that won''t give a shit about used games, as they only buy the brand new versions of COD, Battlefield and FIFA year-in year-out.</p><p>It could well be that the console market begins to die out soon, and it won''t be mobile gaming that replaces it, despite what Mashable, the Daily Mail of the tech world, might have you think. There will always be a demand for high-quality, story-driven games and if this generation doesn''t put the boot in then we might be in danger of proving the PC Gaming Master Race right.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

The biggest, most shocking event to date in the ASOIAF universe, killing off multiple main characters and, as with Eddard Stark''s execution in Season 1/A Game Of Thrones, it''s a gamechanger that completely changes the course of where the storyline appeared to be heading.</span><br></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>I''ve known about the RW for two years now and have been waiting for it to be given the screen treatment, as have thousands of others for much longer than I, because it''s one of the biggest curveballs in recent literary history. It comes from seemingly nowhere, and even when you know it''s coming, it still takes you utterly by surprise. It''s brutal, uncompromising and GRRM''s description is so vivid I think everybody had a very specific image in mind for the scene as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Living up to that would take something truly special, and boy did they hit it - with the sole exception of missing Catelyn''s haunting internal monologue (''No, don’t, don’t cut my hair, Ned loves my hair'') they couldn''t have done anything better. The addition of Talisa''s pregnancy and sudden brutal abortion just made it even more painful, compared to the book where Jeyne Westerling (Robb''s wife) is left behind.<br></p><p>Anyway, there was more to the third series than just the Red Wedding. The most interesting part to me was the addition of Theon''s storyline. In the book universe, Theon disappears for two whole books and then suddenly makes a reappearance as a crippled, cockless man under Ramsay Snow''s control. This season has shown us the missing chapters in unrelenting brutality. If Peter Dinklage was the true star of Season 1, and Alfie Allen of Season 2, Season 3 firmly belongs to Iwan Rheon, who plays the bastard of Bolton to perfection.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p>We also saw a turning point in Jaime Lannister''s character - he''s no longer the arrogant, selfish oathbreaker that we''re used to seeing - the loss of his hand has changed him; scarred him both literally and metaphorically. Jaime shows that he''s actually a good guy. Maybe he always was. He still fucked his sister, though, so... yeah.<br></p><p>And who can forget what''s happening across the narrow sea? Daenerys Targaryen has been fucking up the free cities with her god damned dragons.

Although there is a considerable amount of the third book to get through, it probably won''t take the whole of the next season. What excites me most as a book reader is that the TV series is going to become considerably less predictable, as the 4th and 5th books - A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons, respectively - run chronologically parallel to eachother, and are split between characters. This is simply not practical for a television format, so it''s likely the two storylines will be intertwined on screen. Not only will this make for a new experience, I''m sure they''ll add in more, as they have done the past two series.<br></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

It''s no Discovery, but it certainly isn''t Human After All.</span><br></p>

<p>The sound of RAM has a 70s funk-influenced feel, and when it''s good, it''s catchy, but still well-written enough to stand out from the other vapid background noise on the radio in our age. I can''t single out any track as a bad track, or even one that''s not particularly as good as the others. The problem doesn''t lie in the melody, the style or the lyrics - it''s a bit more complex than that.</p>

<p>For example, take the track ''Giorgio by Moroder''. It''s a great song - once you''ve listened to nearly 3 minutes of Giorgio Moroder''s autobiography. Other songs share a similar affliction (most notably ''Touch''), and the most enjoyable tunes don''t seem to begin until halfway through the track. This makes the album quite difficult to jump in and out of.</p>

<p>So what? I can just listen to the album all the way through, right? Well, that would probably be fine if the pacing was better. The ratio of downtempo songs far outweighs the upbeat ones, and whilst these songs are in no way bad, it makes the album feel repetitive and disappointingly uninspired. A solid playthrough can sound dull, and at times even arrogant. There''s something lacking - the touch of cheesy wit and self-parody that''s been evident in Daft Punk''s previous releases, perhaps - and the long, slow tracks become an empty void of forgettable ambience. </p>

<p>In short, RAM needs more tracks in the same vein as Get Lucky; songs that break the tempo of the other tracks to inject some (much-needed) life. The album version of Get Lucky is six minutes long, but as with anything enjoyable, it seems to be over much quicker. I''m not saying every single track needs to be like this, just a couple more to correct the pacing and <i>Random Acess Memories</i> would, on the whole, be a great piece of music. </p>

<p>As I often seem to do with music reviews, I spend the majority criticising it and it comes across that I dislike it. I do like it: I really like it, in fact. But considering the hype, the build-up, the never-ending praise, it should have been better. Maybe I''m just grumpy, but I know I''m not the only one that feels this way.</p>

By the end of February Manchester United were already twleve points clear and City had thrown away more points than Chelsea have managers. The title race was over before it began, and the quality of football was so poor it was almost laughable. <br><br>Nevertheless, I write my annual blog because this was still a season of note, mostly for the drama that unfolded off the pitch and in the media. Chelsea have gone through two European championship-winning managers in the space of a year, for reasons only crazy billionaire Abramovic will know, and Sir Alex Ferguson retired after 26 years in charge of Manchester United, possibly paving the way for a new club to take their place as the dominant force in English football. Suarez decided he was not only racist, but also a vampire, and Wigan finally, gracefully, triumphantly left the Premiership, winning the FA Cup in the process. </p><p>With all of the big names from my childhood retiring - Ferguson, Scholes, Owen, Beckham, Carragher - it really seems like the end of a footballing generation. It''s a weird experience, and one that makes me feel like a wizened old man as opposed to my youthful and radiant self.  </p><p>Anyway, on to the team of the season.</p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66"><p></p><p>Joe Hart had a relatively poor season by his incredibly high standards, and yet still managed to get four more clean sheets than his closest competitor. This is, admittedly, party due to City''s strong defence, but I stick by my decision to keep Hart in the squad for a third year running. Narrowly losing out were De Gea, who has finally found his feet at United, and Cech, who is still looking nimble at 31.</p><p>In defence, Vincent Kompany proved again to be the best defender in the league - the sparkling light of City''s dwindling star. Also worthy of a mention, though, is United''s Rio Ferdinand, whose return to fitness has proved he can still play at the top level. Patrice Evra and Branislav Ivanovic finish off the defence, both of whom have had sensational seasons both going forward and holding the fort.</p><p>The heart of the midfield is populated by Swansea''s brilliant budget signing Michu and Everton''s hairy giant Fellaini, both of whom have grabbed numerous goals this season. It''ll be interesting to see if either of them stay at their current clubs - Fellaini certainly may follow David Moyes through the door to Manchester United. Gareth Bale is a given to be in the squad - having almost single-handedly driven Tottenham to the highest-ever points record without qualifying for the Champions League, it''ll be an absolute miracle if they hold on to him this summer. And finally, Juan Mata narrowly pips Eden Hazard to the fourth midfield spot for his sensational season.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-07-02/epl-2013.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>The front two are relatively predictable - the two highest scorers in the Premier League this season, the brilliant Van Persie (who I still find strange to see in a Manchester United shirt) and the ever-controversial Luis Suarez. He was clearly as bored of the season as we all were, and decided the best way to liven it up was to take a chunk out of Ivanovic''s arm. It was pretty genuinely hilarious, and Suarez looks like an escapee from Broadmoor.</p><p>So now I have to deal with over three months without football (unless you count the Confederations Cup).

Now it''s been announced that Kiefer Sutherland is set to reprise the role of badass terrorist hunter Jack Bauer in a new series, albeit in a shorter 12-episode format, in May of 2014.</p>

<p>American TV dramas are arguably at an all-time high in popularity: Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, True Blood, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire... the list goes on, all programming popular both in the US and here across the Atlantic. What''s notable in this list is that it''s domianted by shows from American networks AMC and HBO - and Fox is notably lacking. So Fox has pulled the ace that it''s been inconspicuously hiding in its underwear, and brought back their most successful and popular drama series that''s already supposed to be over.</p>

<p>I''m still not sure how I feel about it. I feel like, after 8 seasons of torrid abuse that nobody should have to endure, Jack - already forced to flee the country for what feels like the jathillionth time - should be able to retire in a relatively quiet third-world country to live a quieter life. Maybe Wales. But as I surmised three years ago, the writers left the ending open so that they could bring it back if ratings descended.</p>

The first is obviously David Bowie''s new release, which demonstrates it most effectively, as it was the most sudden appearance. The second is Daft Punk''s upcoming Random Access Memories, which is possibly the most hyped-up album in the history of time, ever. However, Fox may have taken a punt too early: a year is a long time for somebody to stay excited. They''re going to need to do a bit more marketing before final release.</p><p>Anyway, regardless of whether or not I feel it should be coming back I''m going to watch it. I would have watched the movie it had come out, so why wouldn''t I watch a new series? The biggest problem with the original run of 24 was that because it was so absurdly OTT from the very beginning, things that should have been dramatic became less so, and the storyline from series 6 onwards became a little silly - maybe a few years of quiet time will do Jack some good and ground him a little. That, and hopefully Elisha Cuthbert.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>This is an edited cross-post from a question I posed to StackOverflow. It''s partially a question, partially an attempt to raise awareness of an inexplicably under-reported problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=57&amp;cat=1">Google Chrome is one of the best browsers available on the market</a>, partially for its speed but also for its feature support. The last place you''d expect poor performance from a cutting-edge technology is Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Up until recently, HTML5 video performance has been far superior to flash, and in most browsers is still the case, but for the last few months, the HTML5 video element has had a very poor performance in Chrome. Every other browser I''ve tried (IE9/10, Opera, Firefox, Safari, Safari iOS) runs absolutely fine but Chrome (for Windows) buffers very slowly and occasionally stops buffering altogether. It seems to ignore the preload attribute, although according to <a href="http://oddlystudios.com/blog/html5-video-problems-in-chrome/">this article</a> it DOES preload, just limits itself at a couple of MB.</p>

<p>This is definitely a recent issue, probably only affecting recent versions (I''m on 26.0.1410.64 m) and it''s not only affecting my work but also other sites - including giants such as YouTube. It seems to be irrespective of file format, and only seems to affect longer videos (those of 5 minutes and above).</p>

<p>I guess my question is, has anybody else come across this phenomenon? If so, how do you combat it? In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14411977/how-to-deal-with-poor-html5-video-performance-in-chrome">another thread</a> disabling the hardware acceleration for H.264 was suggested, but not only does this not work for me, but it''s impractical from a development standpoint.</p>

<p>I''ll post any updates I find here, but for now join in the conversation either in the comments, or in the following threads:</p>

<p>When you work in technology, or even have a passing interest in it, you''ll hear all the time that this year is the ''year of Linux''. Every year, without fail, is the year of Linux. Except it never is.</p>

<p>Why is this? Every person that I''ve ever known to use Linux has barely looked back since. Its powerful commands, speed and free-for-all ideology appeals to pretty much anybody, and with such a wide range of interfaces and distributions to choose from, you can find one to suit your needs exactly - or even build one, should you have the knowhow. From Ubuntu to Fedora, Unity to Cinnamon; Linux is the ultimate in customisable computer systems.</p>

<p>Well, there''s two reasons. Firstly, people don''t like using what they don''t know. It''s why Windows users get scared and confused when they try to use a Mac, and why Apple fanatics get frustrated at all the menus in Windows. Adding yet another OS into that formula is too difficult for your average user to accept, so it''s already only down to developers or tech enthusiasts willing to make the switch. That''s at least 75% of people alienated.</p>

<p>The second reason is simple, and is what is stopping many techies (including myself) making the permanent switch: games. Linux''s software support has considerably risen since I first started using it ~6 years ago, and any software unsupported normally has an equally good (and sometimes better) free alternative. But game support is poor at best. Yes, you can use WINE to emulate some games, but it''s as buggy as an anthill and still doesn’t support enough.</p>

<p>So now we know why it''s not the year of Linux, how can we make it be so? How can we drive Linux''s market share up so that people can experience the joy of true computing, all for free?</p>

<p>As much as I personally like Windows 8, it''s been a colossal failure critically and commercially. If your non-savvy friends are whining that they can''t find the shut down button on their new Windows 8 laptop, instead of telling them where it''s cleverly hidden - or the fact that you can just close the lid - point them to an entry-level distro like Ubuntu or Mint. Offer to set it up for them, if you must - package management and command lines will understandably be intimidating for those unused to them. But when they see just how much faster they can write documents, browse the Internet or tally up those profits, they''ll be thankful.</p>

<p>And as for the gaming issue, Valve are thinking of you. Steam for Linux is slowly increasing its library - although currently there''s only indie games and titles made by Valve available. As much as I love FTL, Bastion, and Portal, I really would quite like to play my copy of Civ 5 or Bioshock when I accidentally boot into Arch (and sorry, but clones like FreeCiv, Super Tux Kart and OpenArena just don''t quite cut it). Rest assured, when Linux takes off, all companies will be desperate to get their AAA title converted to a AAA Operating System.</p>

<p>Just in case you didn''t infer my sarcastic tone in the last two paragraphs, I don''t expect either of these points to be resolved any time soon. In short, this year isn''t the year of Linux. Nor will next year be. Nor any year, for the foreseeable future. And that''s a shame. But, because Linux is free and open-source, there''s nothing to worry about. It''s not going anywhere. It''ll remain a beacon for nerds the world over, and if we get the blockbuster gaming titles we deserve on this platform, all the better. But there''s no need to force it on everybody else. When the world''s ready to accept Tux, the world will.</p>

<p>After all, he''s a motherfucking penguin. And penguins are awesome.</p>

<p>I love Archer. Really, I do. I think it''s an incredible show that continuously comes up with inventive insults and a brand of wit that''s been unmatched in any other TV show, animated or otherwise. It manages to effortlessly blend the childish and outlandish humour of cartoons and mix it in with the Bond-style spy world that everybody in my demographic loves.</p>

<p>So it''s hard to admit that Season 4 was ultimately disappointing.</p>

<p>To say it was bad or that it was unentertaining would not only be an injustice, it would be completely untrue: I found myself laughing hysterically at certain points, and the finale was fantastic. But there''s one line from Archer himself which rings all too true.</p>
</div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-100" style=""><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-07-03/dangerzone.jpg"></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>I''ve always been impressed that despite being the solitary writer for the show, Adam Reed has consistently put out high quality material, but at several points in S4, he just seemed to completely give up trying, and instead shoved a lazy ''Danger Zone'' in. I''m aware that catchphrases have been at the heart of Archer from day one, I know, but so has subtlety and finesse, rather than just saying ''phrasing'' every time someone says ''hard'' or ''come''. There''s also a scene with Lana and Cheryl where they nearly have a whole conversation in catchphrases: ''What am I, hourly?'' ''Are you not?'' ''You''re not my supervisor!'' ...try a bit harder.</p><p>I''m also a little disappointed at how little the overall story progressed in this season. It''s shown glimpses of some very interesting story arcs; Lana''s baby, the introduction of the bureaucratic weapons requisitions officer Rodney, and the ongoing fight between Barry and Archer over Katya. I was looking forward to seeing these develop. Instead, when Ray ends up in a wheelchair AGAIN at the end of the finale, I breathed a sigh of apathy.</p><p>It''s still great, though. There''s nothing more hilarious than watching Archer investigate the ballistic anomaly of Brett managing to get shot without even being on the same floor, or Kreiger get up to his various narcotic-fuelled experiments. Let''s just hope that for Season 5 things get a bit less... lazy.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

If you don''t want to know what happens, DON''T read ahead.</p>

<p>Not gonna lie - until about three days before Netflix was due to premier its second series of original programming, I had no idea that anything like House of Cards even existed. I saw it advertised on some bus stop close to work and thought to myself, ''Holy shit, my favourite actor and director are doing a new TV series? AND IT''S ON IN THREE DAYS!?''</p>

<p>Because of the wonderful world that we live in I didn''t waste a second in absorbing all of the information I needed to know. It''s a remake of the 80''s BBC miniseries, starring Kevin Spacey and produced by David Fincher - with some episodes directed by Fincher too. The series revolves around a US politician trying to get his way to the top of the food chain after being spurned for a role he was promised. There''s plenty of affairs, drugs, scandals and a fair bit of evil - all masterminded by Frank Underwood, a politician who seems to be able to predict everybody''s moves before they''ve made them.</p>

<p>After I finished watching the series (it took me a while for various reasons) I quickly glossed over a plot summary for the original series. It''s much the same, except there''s 6 or 7 hours worth of extra stuff in the US version, as you''d expect, because British television is always criminally short. The key concepts are all the same, though - obviously spoilers ahead here:</p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><p></p><ul><li>Frank Underwood (main politician) is snubbed by the new government for a bigshot role (secretary of state, in this case);</li><li>Underwood fucks Zowie Barnes (a reporter) to gain leverage over the media;</li><li>Peter Russo (druggy-politician) is caught with hooker (although a woman in the US);</li><li>Russo fucks everything up and Barnes reports it;</li><li>Underwood kills Russo and makes it look like suicide;</li><li>Underwood and Barnes have a tiff about something pathetic and she tries to bring him down;</li><li>Underwood becomes VP.</li></ul><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-07-03/kev.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>Substitute the names and job titles with British ones and you''ve got yourself the core plot of the original series. Apparently at the end of the BBC ones Underwood''s equivalent throws his reporter fuckdoll of the roof of the Houses of Parliament to keep her talking - badass - but nothing similar happens in the US drama. Instead, it appears in the final moments of the season that Zowie Barnes has the upper hand, as Underwood''s right-hand man Stamper is trying in vain to warn him of *something* - who knows?! We''ll have to see next year.</p><p>The series adopts an interesting storytelling style with Underwood frequently breaking the fourth wall to give the audience a monologue, using very sharp language, but often also very poetic, such as the killer line ''I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.'' It''s all very dramatic and makes for excellent television. In a broader sense, too, having such a well-known cast and crew helps to cement Netflix as a serious player in original programming in the near future, and the digital streaming format as a whole.</p><p>Is this format sustainable for the future, though? Well, yes, I think it is. In fact, it may soon threaten the very nature of television as we know it. Whilst the old fuddy-duddy in me likes the idea of scheduled programming so that I have a routine of what I watch when, the truth of the matter is it''s so much more convenient to have all of the episodes at your fingertips immediately, whenever you want them. It''s why we buy DVD''s, right? So let''s take up a little less space, and embrace the digital age.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Bastille are the first band I''ve started listening to in a long time that I truly love: the two singles Pompeii and Flaws are both played so much that I risk making myself hate them, but they''re just so good. So I''ve been pretty excited for an album simply so I don''t ruin my two favourite songs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The album begins with the most recent single, "Pompeii". It''s just unfairly good. It''s a brilliant song musically and thematically: excellent songwriting such as "where do we begin/the rubble or our sins" and a catchy as fuck tune make you feel like its a song by the survivors of the famous Italian city destroyed by a volcano.&nbsp;The other single that I love, "Flaws", appears later on the album, and is just as catchy as Pompeii if not quite as epic. It does seem to end quite suddenly, but as I listened to the album I realised that this was a case with many of the tracks.</p>

<p>This is my main issue with Bad Blood as a whole: many of&nbsp;the tracks are too short and end abruptly. They do also follow the same old format of verse/chorus/verse/chorus/breakdown/verse and that''s a little predictable, but there''s a reason that this has been used in songs across the generations, and that''s because it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following Pompeii, the album continues strongly with "Things We Lost in Fire" and the titular track. We''re three songs in and we already have three brilliant songs. This album is gold.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the slower tracks aren''t great: "Oblivion" is one of the slower songs on the album, and&nbsp;frontman&nbsp;Dan Smith gets a chance to show off his impressive range. It''s mostly piano and violin melodies apart from a strange electronic motif that kicks in halfway through that doesn''t ruin the song but certainly doesn''t sound like it fits in. Another ballad is Get Home, which I much prefer - it still has some electronic sounds in the background but they fit nicely with the piano and don''t jar the song, and I''m not a huge fan of their single "Overjoyed".</p>

<p>There''s a 2-part song on the album, but for some reason Part II of "Weight of Living" appears before Part I (how incredibly artistic!). Part I is the stronger of the two, but they''re both quite good. Listening to them one after another doesn''t make a lot of difference to this.</p>

<p>A few tracks do feel a little bit like filler, but they''re still great: "These Streets" is a fun mid-tempo song that gets your feet tapping, "Icarus" is also a strong track telling the story of the ancient Greek character that flew too close to the sun, and "Daniel in the Den" sounds like it could be a Passion Pit song (no bad thing!).</p>

<p>The album definitely ends on a high:&nbsp;I don''t know who Laura Palmer is, but she''s inspired a hell of a song. In terms of what the songs actually about, I couldn''t tell you - "This is your heart/can you feel it?" is a little generic, but meaningless lyrics aside, the music sounds awesome.&nbsp;"The Silence" is a bit of a misnomer as it has the highest pace of any track on the album by far. It''s definitely one of the standouts due to its unique sound and one of the strongest lyrically too: "it is not enough to be dumbstruck/can you feel the silence?" Finally, we close with&nbsp;"Laughter Lines": it''s another slow song, but rather than the other two trying to be power ballads, it feels like a slow song that Bastille have written themselves, suiting their own style.</p>

<p>So whilst there isn''t really anything that betters Pompeii, and some of the&nbsp; tracks are too short and abrupt, on the whole it''s an amazing album - one of the best I''ve heard in a long, long time. It''s a shame that "Poet", the excellent b-side on the Pompeii EP, didn''t make the final cut for the album, but it''s not really a problem. The ballads are definitely the weakest tracks, but when Bastille stick to the formula they''ve made for themselves, they''re brilliant.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Music', N'Bastille are the first band I''ve started listening to in a long time that I truly love', N'bastille, bad blood, pompeii, laura palmer, electro-indie', '20130304 16:58:20', '20130703 16:58:20', 1, 1)

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>Sony''s press conference on Feb 20 basically confirmed everything that we already knew. Their next console will be called the PlayStation 4, unsurprisingly, and although we haven''t seen the console itself, we know pretty much all about it.</p>

<p>Let''s start off with the nitty-gritty technicals: the PS4 uses a highly enhanced x86 PC architecture and graphics card, with 8GB of DDR5 Memory and will use the most sensible and stable storage option of a HDD. It all sounds pretty impressive, but we''re left lacking any formal specifications. So we look to the games and tech demos - read about these later on.</p>

<p>The DualShock 4 is the most radical redesign of a PlayStation controller, ever. It heavily borrows from the Xbox 360''s ergonomics and looks nearly identical to the photograph that''s been circling the Internet over the past week or so. It''s slimmer than the oversized and clunky 360 controller, so the new shape should be OK - although the one thing they haven''t stolen that they should have is the analog stick position. They''ve rectified the most pressing issue, though, which is the Dual Shock 3''s clumsy and uncomfortable shoulder triggers, which look much more solid and durable.</p>

<img src="http://declantyson.net/ImageHandler.ashx?imgid=139" alt="PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 controller">

<p>There''s some interesting additions. A headphone jack and loudspeaker are natural and welcome, but the inclusion of a touchpad seems completely and utterly pointless. It also rips off the Kinect with some kind of camera depth-perception, but surprisingly little was actually said about that during the announcement.</p>

<p>One of the more subtle and interesting features is a ''Share'' button. The PS4 will be constantly recording your gameplay and by pressing the share button you can export video of up to the last quarter hour of gameplay. This is a cool touch, and will make Let''s Play videos much more common and allow us to actually share those hilarious replays from PES. In Sony''s words, they''re trying to make the first social network solely dedicated to gaming.</p>

<img src="http://declantyson.net/ImageHandler.ashx?imgid=140" alt="DualShock 4 share button">

<p>As it was Sony, stealing and improving Nintendo''s innovation is one of the biggest non-surprises of this entire conference. In a knee-jerk reaction to the Wii U, they''re pushing the idea of Remote Gaming and Connectivity between their consoles, as well as apps for iOS and Android allowing you to use the PlayStation Network on the go just that little bit more than Nintendo. Sony have been experimenting with the idea of connectivity between the Vita and PS3 for a while now, and are obviously finding it more successful than Nintendo did with the GBA and Gamecube to be pushing it so hard.</p>

<p>And of course, the PS4 will utilise cloud gaming. So well, they claim, that you''ll be able to stream games while they download - how well that''s actually going to work remains to be seen, but it sounds somewhat ambitious. In another effort to reduce download times, Sony claims it will use your gaming history and PlayStation network activity to preemptively download titles that it predicts you''ll want - so all you have to do is pay for the unlock code to play. Aside from the borderline creepiness that comes with this targeted marketing and the potential issue to use up all your space (depending on how big your HD is) I think Sony may live to regret this decision as it will surely increase the risk of piracy if the game data is already on your console, begging to be cracked!</p>

<p>On to the games and tech demos. A brand new franchise, Knack, is a Ratchet and Clank-style action platformer that stars some little robot thing (for a while I thought they were saying ''Mach'') that conveniently can pick up a lot of debris and turn into some gigantic orc-type thing made out of more particles than you could possibly imagine, just to show how many particles they can generate at any one time.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oez_gvMxOF0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Then there''s Killzone: Shadow Fall, a much more conventional game, showing off the console''s shading and texture handling:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W77GkC401h8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After Killzone some cockney gangster came on and talked about Driveclub (possibly styled DRIVECLUB but I haven''t figured that out yet). Now this is where the console really shows off it''s graphical power, and the gangster made a big deal out of it, and ''microscopic details'', and then we see the exciting action of the first-person driver opening the door of a Lamborghini, slowly climbing in and putting on his seatbelt before we fade to black and get a montage of about 10 seconds of racing followed by a bunch of menus - they''re really pushing the social aspect in DRIVECLUB.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, it looks gorgeous.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/INNS-zhmFZI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Next, some liberal douche came on and tells us that he ain''t gonna be a part of the system. Just before he gets kicked out for crashing the stage and bringing everybody down, he somehow relates this to the new Infamous game, Second Son.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tHSeyPl--Fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Then we''ve got The Witness which pretty much looks like Flow Free on Steroids.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tk-RsawGjPY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>For me, the most interesting game demo was by far Watchdogs - an open-world game from Ubisoft where everything is hackable. It looks brilliant.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GICaRqAao" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Capcom''s Yoshinori Ono variantly fought past his poor command of Engrish to introduce his plesentation, before giving up and using his transrator to finish the lest in Japanese. He then showed a video for a new IP and game engine with the working title ''Deep Down'' which features a bunch of Samurais fighting a big-ass dragon. Blizzard announced Diablo III for the PS3 and PS4, and Activision signalled that Bungie''s project Destiny will also be a PS4 game.</p>

<p>Game trailers weren''t the only thing that were shown off. They''re really marketing the console to the developers - a rep from Square Enix says that the dev kit is ''super easy'' to use, and that it''s a ''developer''s dream''. Sony showed a montage of other developers speaking of their high regard for the console and its potential. Quantic Dream director David Cage showed a creepy old man being rendered in real-time by the PS4. It''s not quite photorealistic, but it''s extremely impressive. Square Enix showed off a new game engine, again using an exorbitant amount of particles. There''s no doubt that the processing power of the console is vastly superior to this generation and graphically it''s currently without competition.</p>

<p>A rep from MediaMolecule spoke about ''recording your dreams'' - not literally, of course, but using PS Move and the most impressive engineering tool I''ve ever seen to sculpt models in a matter of seconds. Imagine the possibilities with this: combine this tool with a new SimCity game, or a driving simulator to build your own cars from the ground up.</p>

<p>The subject of backwards compatibility was touched upon, and it turns out that the PS4 has the potential to run games all the way back to the PSOne ''someday'' - not really sure what to make of that.</p>

<p>All in all, there were no big surprises, but it''s mostly positive. The tech looks good, the games are promising, and the controller hasn''t been absolutely butchered. My only concern is that Sony might be trying to do too much - ambition is a wonderful thing, but - as Peter Molyneux has shown time and time again - failure to deliver on your promises is not. With a slated release window of Christmas 2013, we''ll likely hear the price and see the box of the console itself at E3 this year. In the meantime, don''t be surprised if MS hold a similar conference sometime before June 11 - with Nintendo''s hand in play and Sony placing its chips on the table, it''s Microsoft''s turn to check, raise or fold.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>You can compare web design trends to fashion trends. Everyone the web over is raving about ''responsive design'' as the emerging trend. I feel that this is like saying that dresses will be in fashion this year: it''s a broad generalisation, that, whilst most probably true, is not a ''trend''. Trends, to me, are about the details: colours, buckles instead of buttons, a ruffle, or stuff like that. I don''t know fashion. Web design trends, too - for me, at least - are about details.

</p><p>So I''m not going to say responsive design or the often wrongly-used phrase ''HTML5'' are going to be trends in 2013. I''m going to focus on the details.

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Hyper-minimalism</h3><p>This is the big thing that all of the details will be stuck onto. ''Less is more'' tends to be a staple of graphic design anyway, but just recently this has come even more into the forefront. Tying in with the ''content is king'' ideology that SEOs brought in with Google''s ''Penguin'' update,  designers also try to bring content to the forefront.

</p><p>Expect to see less images (in many cases, no images at all), single colour pages, icons rather than text in navigation. The only content is the content, everything else is deemed unnecessary. If nothing else, this trend should make for some fast browsing.

<a href="http://warpspire.com/">WarpSpire</a>

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Very light greys</h3><p>#FAFAFA is in in a big way. You might think that''s oddly specific, but it''s one of the most used shade of grey that wasn''t written by a menopausal middle-aged woman - and I guess you could just say that grey is in style right now. It''s particularly used as a background colour.

</p><p>The most probable cause for this resurgence of grey is to do with Apple''s increased stronghold in the desktop and laptop market. Grey has long been the staple colour of OS X and is integral to its design. Twitter Bootstrap also uses grey heavily. Because of the new trend for hyper-minimalism, most sites seem to have stuck with one colour - often Gainsboro (#DCDCDC) or Grey98(#FAFAFA).

<a href="https://trello.com/login">Trello</a>

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Full-sized background images</h3>

<p></p><p>Almost an alternative to the grey, another emerging trend are photographs that take up the whole screen, with a very small amount of content overlaid in a floating box. Although mostly employed in login screen, it''s often used as a background for blogs. This sort of approach would be very nice as a photographer''s portfolio; particularly for wedding photography, as it''s elegant and pretty.

</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> <br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Serif fonts</h3>

<p></p><p>Continuing the elegance, Serif Fonts are now cool again. Georgia in particular has made several appearances across the web. They tie in very nicely to the minimalistic theme bought by the other elements and - providing you''ve got a nice one (obviously not Times New Roman) - I welcome the return. There''s nothing wrong with a good, clean serif font - and I seem to be one of the only people on the planet who isn''t really a fan of Helvetica.

</p><p><a href="http://dev.hasenj.org/">Hasen el Judy</a>

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Circles</h3><p>This is an interesting one, and one that I quite like. A lot of photographs and images - display pictures, featured images and the like - are encased in porthole-like fashion. It''s neat, sleek and modern, and probably the element you''ll most likely be able to fit in to existing web designs.

<a href="https://medium.com/design-startups/6c423fc5ccef">Medium</a>

</p><h3 style="font-size:18px;padding: 15px 0;">Parallax scrolling</h3>

<p></p><p>Parallax scrolling is a complicated beast and one you could easily write a whole article on that alone. It takes simple design - including the full-sized background images, often - and turns it into a visual phenomenon. Whilst impressive to those of us who have high-end machines and decent browsers, until performance is improved, parallax may not take off for the majority of users still stuck on IE8, unable or unwilling to upgrade.

<hr>

<p>I won''t be using many of these trends on declantyson.net <i>(edit: I did end up using the full-size background images. edit edit: and the minimalism and circles and parallax scrolling and the very light greys....)</i>, but I''ll definitely consider them when it comes to any new projects.

</p><p>I stress at this point that these trends are in no way definitive or exhaustive. Bringing back to the fashion analogy - this is a runway, where you see the extreme cases. As a designer, you need to take the elements you see and make them into something that does the job that you require it to, not just for the sake of using it. That''s how bad design starts. </p>

The biggest one of these is the way that you actually score points: rather than knocking a character off the edge of the stage, you have to build up your special bar, and it''s only by landing these specials that you can score points. The specials are irrelevant, hilarious and ridiculous. There are three different levels, increasing in power each time, before you get to the almighty Level 3, which almost always destroys every other player on the stage instantly. They''re like final smashes, but there aren''t any shit ones like Jigglypuff growing bigger.</p><p>This system is a little strange to get used to, but it works quite well. It''s particularly good on the Kill Limit victory condition, something that''s severely lacking in Smash Bros - it makes the game about actually doing well, and you can''t just float around trying not to die. You actually have to play the game.</p><p>Having said that, before I could play this extensively, my PS3 YLOD''d on me. Fan-fucking-tastic. I took a short break from writing this blog to play PSOne roms until my eyes bled nostalgia.</p><p>Then my lovely girlfriend rescued me and returned me to the world of modern gaming with a brand-spanking new PS3. After a short while, I finally retrieved my All Stars disc from the dead 60GB giant and began to write this blog again.</p><p>The character roster is a mixed bag. It has 20 characters by default with more to come as downloadable content - not to be sniffed at - but when you compare it to the 38 that Brawl provides, it seems miniscule. There''s also at least three glaring omissions from Sony''s history: no longer exclusives, maybe, but Spyro, Crash and Lara Croft should have been in there without hesitation, as they''re an integral part of the fabric that made Sony''s original console successful. And although there aren''t as many clone characters as in Smash Bros, there are some seriously overpowered characters - the balance is significantly worse. Kratos and Raiden - Kratos more so - are so unbelievably difficult to play against that a three year old who has never picked up a PlayStation controller and is blind could beat a pro champion with ease. This makes online play basically you wishing that you don''t get matched against one of those two characters.</p><p>The online as a whole, though, is excellent - far better than the disappointing shambles that was Brawl''s online. Very little lag, good connection times, the same modes as offline, and all round good fun. The single player is pretty dull, but that''s to be expected, really - it''s designed to be a purely multiplayer experience, and it hits that sweet spot beautifully. Not many games provide good local multiplayer anymore, but this is one of them.</p><p>All Stars may be a rip-off of Brawl, but it''s been wary of the mistakes that Nintendo and HAL made, and it''s a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I look forward to the DLC characters that come our way in the future, and hope and pray that Crash Bandicoot pops his head up.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><h3><hr></h3><h3>AWARD ONE: ALBUM OF THE YEAR</h3>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66"><p>There''s been a substantial amount of good music released this year. This makes a very nice change to the drivel that pours out from Radio 1 every weekday morning. Of course, it''s mostly still shit, but some good does occasionally break through from the wave of ear-crushing disappointment: Band of Skull''s Sweet Sour, or Alex Clare''s ''Too Close'' of the infamous lying IE9 advert. Mancunian electropop quintet Swiss Lips also released a couple of brilliant songs, such as ''U Got The Power''. Unfortunately, Sweet Sour is only half good, aside from ''Too Close'' The Lateness of the Hour is awful, and Swiss Lips still haven''t released an album.</p><p>There were others for consideration. Van Halen bounced back onto the scene with the brilliant A Different Kind of Truth. The always weird, occasionally brilliant electric-rock group Shaka Ponk released another intriguingly strange album entitled The Geeks and the Jerkin'' Socks. As I Lay Dying showcased a decade of metalcore in Awakened. Queen-influenced indie band Fun released a mostly decent effort. But the eventual winner of this most prestigious award goes to&nbsp;<b>Passion Pit - Gossamer</b>. Simultaneously the most cheerful and miserable album in the world, it''s a beautiful piece of music, and it beats out their previous album, Manners, by some distance - which is no small feat at all. Despite the rather depressing lyrics, you always come out the other side with a smile on your face.</p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-16/Passion-Pit-Gossamer[1].jpg"></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><h3><hr></h3><h3>AWARD TWO: GAME OF THE YEAR</h3>

That''s not to say there haven''t been good games - very good games, in fact - but they''ve been few and far between and you can see the struggle for innovation as the current generation slowly stutters to a halt. The release of the Wii U will hopefully shift Microsoft and Sony into gear for E3 this year, as the Xbox 360 did nearly 7 years ago. By the time this generation is truly done, it''ll probably be one of the longest on record.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Having not bought a Wii U (I would like to, but out of principle I refuse to pay nearly £300 for it - the second it comes down in price you''ll see me change my mind) I can''t comment on games like ZombiU, New Super Mario Bros. U and NintendoLand - so unfortunately, they don''t come into consideration this time (although they all look superb).<br></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">So that leaves the rather scattered array of triple-A games scattered across the year. And, to be honest,&nbsp;</span><b style="line-height: 1.45em;">Borderlands 2&nbsp;</b><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">stands head and shoulders above them all. It doesn''t push the boundaries of creativity, by any means - but just like its predecessor, the humour, variety and entertainment factors are second to none.</span><br></p>

</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>I don''t think I can honestly remember a year in which I watched so many good films, or wanted to go to the cinema quite as often.

The Avengers was the first to arrive, and it perfectly combined action and humour, turning four average franchises into one truly brilliant film. Then in the summer came the final chapter in Nolan''s Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises.

Personally I''m more looking forward to Luigi''s Mansion: Dark Moon, Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes, Metal Gear Rising (I think) and the brilliant looking The Last Of Us. However, the thing that excites me most about 2013 is&nbsp;<b>E3</b>&nbsp;- now that Nintendo have made the first move in the game of consoles, either Microsoft or Sony - or maybe even Steam - will have to come up with something to stem the tide that will inevitably come when the WiiU lowers in price.

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable" style=""><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-75" style=""><p>As I Lay Dying''s latest effort doesn''t waste any time, leading into a breakneck thrash track that, frankly, beats the shit out of every track on The Powerless Rise. ''Cauterize'' is an absolute quality track, even if it''s not one of their most catchy - the chorus of ''I''m caught between the feeling of being pulled apart of stuffed into a cell'' just doesn''t roll as well as some of the melodies they''ve previously blasted out. ''A Greater Foundation'' continues this incredibly high tempo, and decides to basically turn the song into one huge breakdown, with a very Killswitch-esque melodic breakdown towards the end of the song.</p><p>This classic metalcore style is something that continues throughout the album. Maybe they were aware that the thrash route on The Powerless Rise was a bit weaker - and certainly less suited to Tim Lambesis'' voice than pure metalcore - and it''s something they''ve very much rectified here. Whilst ''A Greater Foundation'' could be a Killswitch Engage song, ''Resilience'' is something that sounds like it was a missing track on their own An Ocean Between Us (only a good thing). ''Wasted Words'' is closer to their Frail Words Collapse sound, and is also similar thematically - ''All the wasted words I said/In all the cities that I left'' echoes ''Elegy'' in more ways than one, but it also draws elements from Chimaira''s eastern-inspired tuning.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-25" style=""><p><i>Of course, since I wrote this review frontman Tim Lambesis has been arrested for paying someone to murder his wife, with fairly conclusive evidence. I''d like to point out my appreciation of his musicianship does not transfer to an apparently steroid-fueled crime.</i></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><center></center>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">It''s traditional for an As I Lay Dying album to have a ''slow'' song on it (that''s still insanely heavy) and the first minute of ''Overcome'' tricks you into thinking it''s going to be that, before it slams on the gas and rips your ears out in a hailstorm of steel riffs. It shares a name with one of All That Remains'' albums (one of the poor ones, post Fall of Ideals) and at some points you almost think you are listening to All That Remains, with Lambesis emulating Phil Labonte''s vocals, and the guitars sound SO much like that found on The Fall Of Ideals. The following two tracks, ''No Lungs To Breathe'' and ''Defender'', also feels very ATR-ey, although later ATR (so not quite as good).</span><br></p>

<p>The actual ''slow'' song on the album isn''t even that slow, and it''s saved until the very end in ''Tear Out My Eyes''. It''s a good song, but the strength of a song like ''Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Soldier'' is it''s strong lyrics, and forgive me, but ''Before I tear out my eyes/I''ll just admit they''re part of me'' is not the best example of this band''s songwriting.</p>

<p>Of course, like every album - and metal albums in particular - there are some songs that will just become background noise compared to the other standout tracks. One of those tracks is ''Whispering Silence'', which is the song that tries to emulate the sound that they adopted on TPR. But this is one out of many, and the many are very good. </p>

<p>Before the final two tracks, we have a short, calm, instrumental called ''Washed Away'', which prepares us for the most classic As I Lay Dying track on the album: ''My Only Home''. It perfectly blends the melodies introduced in Shadows Are Security with the riffing found on An Ocean Between Us and using the unusual song structure found on Frail Words Collapse, and then it bursts into an incredible breakdown that you''d find on Beneath The Encasing of Ashes. This is my personal favourite song on the album.</p>

<p>Basically, do you like metalcore? Because this is mostly a compilation of all the different styles of metalcore that have emerged over the past decade and printed in one nostalgia-filled disc. It''ll take a few listens for me to really know where it stands compared to their previous albums, but quite simply, it''s bloody fantastic.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>In the post-Minecraft era, it now seems customary for games with confusing concepts to have absolutely no information about how to play.

Does anyone remember those? When you bought a new game that you were too excited to wait to play, you would open the case to find an instruction manual with controls, a brief introduction to the story and the characters. In some cases, developers put a hell of a lot of effort into making the booklet part of their game world. Most of the time now, you’ll get one thin sheet of paper with an online pass code and some lame promotion. It may seem like a minor complaint, but it’s a sign of a developer that truly cares about their product when you get a proper instruction booklet, and a Wiki or PDF will never be able to replace that - it’s one of the great losses of the digital age.</p><p>This Humble Bundle isn''t actually available because I seem to keep leaving it a week or two after I''ve written my blog posts before putting them up. <del>However, there''s currently a cool&nbsp;<a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">THQ bundle</a>&nbsp;available now!

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>I wrote this review a good week or two ago, but my busy schedule has dictated that I haven''t got around to posting it until now.*</p>

<p>When you turn on Windows 8 for the first time after installation, your immediate response will be, ''what the hell do I do now?''</p>

<p>There''s a lovely little message that warmly tells you to move your cursor to the top right corner of the screen to bring up the faux-start menu that consists of 5 different ''charms'' that vary in function for every app that is used. But it still feels incredibly unnatural to move the cursor to this place to do anything. That''s when I realised just how tablet-orientated Microsoft have gone with the operating system - a swipe function that would feel so natural on a touch-screen interface feels clumsy and idiotic when you''re using a mouse or trackpad.</p>

<p>It took me all of 5 seconds, though, to press the magical Windows key that brings up the Start screen without all that bother. And the Metro menu is absolutely bloody beautiful. Again, it''s clearly optimised for tablet use, but in this case it doesn''t matter - everything is within a click away and there are shortcuts aplenty (like just typing for what you want to search for, rather than going top right corner... Search... What do you want to search). These shortcuts - at first hidden but then when revealed so utterly natural - is what makes Windows 8 a usable system.</p>

<p>The default apps that Windows 8 comes with are all very clean, crisp and pretty. Calendar, OneNote, and Mail in particular function excellently, and the News, Sports and Weather apps are all immaculately presented. The one slight confusion is the horizontal scrolling. This is a major irritant for me. There is never, EVER, a good reason for horizontal scrolling. Yes, you can swipe left+right on a tablet, but this is generally only limited for interactive image scrollers or apps pretending to be newspapers - not what is essentially a webpage. You can use scroll wheels and touch movements to scroll ''up'' and ''down'' instead of left and right, but it just feels awkward.</p>

<p>The best part of Windows 8, though, is its fundamental principle of running everything concurrently.

Production of Bond 23 was put on indefinite hold. Luckily for everybody in the world, the studio emerged from bankruptcy before the year was out, and immediately set back to work on one of their biggest franchises - albeit at a slightly reduced budget.</p><p><b>Before you continue, please bear this in mind: this review is completely full of spoilers and I''m not going to mark them. Just watch the bloody film first.</b></p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Skyfall is probably the least ''Bond'' of all the Bonds. The tone is completely different, the structure isn''t even remotely similar to the Goldfinger formula, and if it wasn''t for the characters, you would be forgiven for thinking you were watching a completely different series. Ironically, I think that despite the complaints, Quantum of Solace is actually the&nbsp;<i>most</i>&nbsp;Bond-like of all Craig''s films.</p><p>Having got that off my chest - Skyfall is, by an absolute mile, the best film of 2012.</p><p>That''s no small feat in a year that''s seen The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, Looper, Lawless and more still. The whole production team has clearly taken an absolutely ridiculous amount of inspiration from The Dark Knight (more on that later) and they''ve taken on board every single criticism that came Quantum of Solace''s way. It''s a fantastic film.</p><p>But it''s not perfect.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p></p>
</div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-22/m-skyfall.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p style="margin:0;">What impressed me most about Skyfall is, despite the fact that the majority of the $150m budget was clearly being spent on a massive marketing campaign, they managed to keep M''s death completely under wraps. Sure, by the time the film is halfway through it''s fairly obvious that''s what''s going to happen, but before entering the screen I had absolutely no idea. Dench shines in her final outing in the role - she departs the series with the same amount of appearances as Sir Roger Moore (one more, if you count the fact that he wasn''t really in A View To A Kill) and deserves every inch of praise she''ll get for her services to the franchise.<br></p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>Where Quantum was too jet-set for its own good, Skyfall takes a much more subdued path, only stopping through Turkey and China before spending the majority of the film back in good ol'' Blighty. This isn''t a bad thing though, it''s a good amount that makes the storyline flow with a lot more sense. Every lead, thread and tail has a reason, and each location has its own focus. The bike chase across Turkish rooftops is gripping. The chase through London Underground is exciting (and holds close sentimental value to us Brits). Bond''s fight with an assassin in Shanghai is breathtaking. And the finale in (''Welcome to'') Scotland is just bloody brilliant.</p><p>The whole film echos The Dark Knight in many ways. The music could have been lifted straight from a Christopher Nolan film, and the scenes in Shanghai particularly echo the futuristic-cross-gothic style that the Batman trilogy evokes. MI6''s new bunker shares many design elements with the Batcave, and if the film had come any later, I''d say that Bond becoming a washed-up old man who is losing all his skills was directly lifted from&nbsp;<i>TDKR</i>.</p><p>There is one glaringly obvious comparison to draw, though. In the same way that The Dark Knight wasn''t a Christian Bale film, Skyfall isn''t a Daniel Craig film. Javier Bardem is Skyfall''s Heath Ledger. Give the Joker a motive, and you have Raoul Silva. He plans his attacks years in advance, letting people believe they''re winning before punching them in the metaphorical groin and running riot - such as when he''s a captive of&nbsp;<del>Batman</del>&nbsp;MI6 and escapes by&nbsp;<del>planting a bomb in an inmate''s stomach</del>&nbsp;releasing a pre-compiled virus to open all of the bunker''s security. This leads to the best scene of the film where M is reading poetry at her hearing, blissfully unaware of the approaching chaos that Silva and his men are causing outside.</p><p>I could go on all day about Skyfall''s best bits, but I''m going to sum up here: every action sequence is brilliant, it has the best storyline and villain that the series has seen so far, and the script is consistently strong.</p><p>But like I said, it''s not perfect.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Continuing the Bond reboot, some major characters have been re-cast. Q is done quite well, a modern techie who is a bit more arrogant than he deserves to be and you can see where they''re going to take the role. However, Moneypenny''s new story is appalling. The idea of making her a strong, empowered agent who works the field is a bit stupid considering she ends up essentially being M''s bitch. If she retired from field work she would get a considerably more respectable role than secretary. Naomie Harris is also a pretty poor actress, and both her and Craig seem to wince at their love scenes, compared to the brilliant chemistry that was present between Lois Maxwell and Connery.</p><p>One major issue I took with the film is the amount of ''tributes'' there were littered around. The ejector seat button, the exploding pen, and many other things make the film feel like a ''spot-the-reference'' game that often leaves me cringing. I get that it''s the 50th anniversary, but Die Another Day went down that path, and it was a bad idea. It also leads to some serious continuity issues. You can''t have a rebooted Bond with a new Miss Moneypenny, Felix Leiter and James Bond but then leave in the exact same car from 1964. I welcomed the return of the beautiful Aston Martin, but it should have been reinvented along with the rest of the franchise.</p><p>My last gripe is rather minor, really - I was excited to see Daniel Kleiman''s title sequence after the brilliant ones he did for Casino Royale, but it was a little underwhelming. However, this is something that I''m almost 100% sure will be better on the second watch with the benefit of hindsight. And you can tell I''m clutching at straws if I''m criticising the credits, which in most films is white text on black.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>I''m not an Adele fan, but this song is perfect. It''s classic 007 through and through, and it suits the darker, more sinister tone of the film absolutely perfectly, and the lyrics - whilst as always a little nonsensical in their order - allude to various moments throughout the film. I will say that the second I heard the opening line ''this is the end'' I put that together with the knowledge that 007 ''dies'' to get that the title sequence would begin with him falling into water to Adele''s warblings. Talk about minor spoilers. I''m just glad they removed the line ''M is dead'' before it made the final cut, otherwise the whole film would have been ruined.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

For outside, on a sign, were words that I did not expect to see:</p><p></p><h3>Sir Roger Moore</h3><p>Will be signing his new book on October 13th, 2012 at 3 p.m.</p><p>I knew I had to. This would probably be my only chance ever to meet a real-life Bond. He wasn''t the best Bond, but he wasn''t the worst, and dammit, even Lazenby was a Bond. I''d take anything.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><p>Diligently, Gabi kindly stood in line for four hours with me to meet one of my heroes. As the time approached we both became increasingly excited - this man was a knight, known the world over, and I was going to meet him, face-to-face. What would I say? What would I do? Doubts started to form in my head as to whether I could actually handle this. I would be under so much pressure to say something to this man that had shaped my childhood so much, something memorable. Of course, he''s 85, so that wasn''t going to happen, so I stopped trying to.</p><p>As we were waiting, a birthday card for Ol'' Sir Rodge was passed round to us, so I was forced to write a message to him that he probably wouldn''t read, but I wrote simply - <span style="font-family:cursive">Happy Birthday, you absolute legend.</span> Hopefully I''d be able to come up with something more witty soon. Gabi went for the more inventive <span style="font-family:cursive">My boyfriend wishes he was you... and I wouldn''t mind!</span> (Pretty much 100% true).</p><p>Shortly after, the queue began to shuffle forward, bit by bit. My heart skipped a beat. Roger Moore was actually here. He was 100 fucking feet away, and I started to lose it a bit in my mind. Slowly but surely, we made our way into the shop. Gabi got the camera at the ready as my hands were shaking far too much to take photos myself. We peered round the screen, and there he was.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-23/2012-10-14 18.44.35.jpg"></div></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-100" style=""><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-23/2012-10-13 15.42.39.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>We were told he couldn''t stand up very well and that due to time constraits there would be no dedications or posed photography. By this point I didn''t care - he was 85, frankly I was impressed he had left the house. I was too busy trying to place myself in the very real situation that I was in the same room as James Bond. My book was passed to him. My turn was up.</p><p>As he signed the book, my mind was racing. I couldn''t say&nbsp;<em>nothing</em>. So for some reason I turned into Bill S. Preston and Ted Theodore Logan and said "You''re excellent!". It made me realise that I very rarely say the word "excellent" out loud. Having heard it all one-hundred-and-ten times already that afternoon, he smiled to me and said "Have a nice day". As I was&nbsp;<del>dragged</del>&nbsp;escorted quickly away from the desk, I called back "It was amazing to meet you!". I then had to stand in awe for a second. Firstly because I''d met a hero, secondly because all I could say to him was "You''re excellent", and thirdly because James Bond had told me to have a nice day.</p><p>Ok, I promise after Skyfall there''ll be no more Bond blogs for a while. Unless Sean, Timmy, Pierce, Daniel, or even George pop by unexpectedly.</p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

The naysayers were suddenly praising Daniel Craig and James Bond was seen as relevant in the world of film again - a true competitor for the likes of Jason Bourne. And yet, when all seemed rosy in the world of EON productions, a massive shock hit the motion picture industry that would change film and television for the whole of 2008 - the Writer''s Strike. As a result, many shows and films were canceled or postponed, and the ones that were completed were widely derided by critics and fans alike - it was almost directly responsible for the end of the popularity of<em>Heroes</em>, so it was a very precarious time for any studio to release a film.</p><p>Paul Haggis rushed to finish the script for Quantum of Solace two hours before the strike began.</p><h3>So, is it any good?</h3><p>Quantum of Solace is a series of below-average action sequences barely held together by a surprisingly good script that the flimsy plot doesn''t deserve. I''ll list my issues with the film in detail in a second, but overall, it''s just not a good film. It''s not ''Bond'' in any sense, but even if you take it out of this context that connotes such strict conventions and standards, it''s poor.</p><h3>What''s the best bit?</h3><p>Despite the low quality of the film, there are some highs. Judi Dench and Daniel Craig have an irresistible on-screen chemistry that Brosnan never acheived and other excellent performances from the whole cast stop the film from degrading even further. And despite the writer''s strike, the script shines through - lines like ''Florists use that expression! It doesn''t mean they literally have people inside the bloody room!'' in response to Mr. White''s ''We have people everywhere'' and ''Well that wasn''t very nice!'' really bring a smile to your face. It''s just a shame that there''s far too little dialog in between a lot of action sequences that seem unnecessary and only added in to pad out the film''s already short length.</p><p>Having said that, the clock tower fight at the beginning of the film is really enjoyable and has some excellent choreography and camerawork and is actually relevant to the storyline.</p><p>The absolute best part about Craig''s Bond is how nonchalantly badass he is. When he hangs up his phone, he casually throws it away without a second thought (similar to when he throws car keys over his shoulder in Casino Royale). But he reaches the epitome when he snaps off a door handle with practically no effort and then pretends nothing happened. He may lack the suavity of his predecessors, but he more than makes up for it in sheer awesomeness.</p><p></p>

There are advantages to using a handheld camera: you can get better shots from tighter angles, and little bit of shakiness gives an extra sense of realism and makes the audience feel more involved in the film. It''s all about immersion. But there is a limit. Every single action sequence in Quantum of Solace sees this limit, runs at it and then vaults as far as it can past it. It gets to the point where I have literally no idea what the hell is going on. Add into this the fact that the shots are cut every 0.0000000000000000000001 seconds and you have a film that is mostly indecipherable to the human eye.</p><p></p><p>Shaky cam is also prevelant in what is a potentially good pre-title sequence; but after a confusing car chase it''s abruptly cut short by the solitary piece of dialog in the scene. There''s no story development or introduction, and if you didn''t watch Casino Royale you''d be completely lost. And maybe it''s just my DVD, but what''s with the 2-3 second freezeframe before the titles themselves start? Is it meant to look good? Because it doesn''t. Another potentially good action sequence ruined by this shoddy camerawork is the fight in the Bregenz Opera House: the sound is drowned out except for the Opera in the background and it''s very exciting and dramatic, but because you can''t tell what''s going on you just presume Bond''s going to win and switch off until the fight''s over.</p><p></p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66"><p>When you work in design, and more specifically software design, you notice the computer software in films. You analyse them and their realism, how it was developed and its usability (if you want to stop reading, I can''t say I blame you at this point). Whilst QoS isn''t as ridiculous as some, it seems that they''ve spent more time developing this elaborate operating system than making the actual bloody film. It''s on screen every single time a member of MI6 is and is apparently telepathic. (While I''m on the topic of design, those fancy title cards for each location are just kind of annoying really). I also owned a Sony Ericsson C902, and it cannot do the things that they are claiming it can do.<br></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-33"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-23/qs2.jpg"></div></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-66" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-08-23/qs3.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-33"><p></p><p>Any character introduced that''s not a recurring character from Casino Royale seems to be bad.

She''s also on the receiving end of one of the film''s more peculiar lines. ''I can''t find the.. uhh.. stationery.'' I don''t understand - honestly, I just can''t fathom - 1) Why 007 is looking for pencils 2) How Gemma Arteton interpreted that and 3) ANYTHING ABOUT THIS LINE WHATSOEVER. I know Roger Moore had some pretty piss-poor chat up lines in his day, but this takes the award.<br></p><p></p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Appalling, even worse than Madonna. I refuse to comment on this any longer.</p><hr><p>I''ve only been doing Blogalongabond for 9 months and I feel like I''m going to be lost without it after Skyfall! I can''t imagine how the people who did it for all 23 must feel. Watching all of them in order once again has reminded me of the series highs and lows, and just why I love them so damn much.

I’m not proud of it, and I fear that Google have undertaken an automated process to hunt me down, cut off my fingernails and use them as an advanced form of microchip for a deceptively sugary sounding smartphone, like Android 4.2: ToffeeFudgeButterscotchCake.</p><p>That’s right, I’ve bought an Apple product. More specifically, an iPhone&nbsp;<del>5</del>&nbsp;6 (because I can fucking count, Apple).</p><p>I’ve resisted from Apple-bashing anywhere on this blog because I respect what they’ve done for the technology industry, but that doesn’t change the fact that I don’t like most of their products and their business structure of steal/sue/repeat (I’m fully aware this is also Microsoft’s business model, but I consider them the lesser of two evils). I will never buy a Mac of any kind, nor will I buy an iPad (or any tablet, for that matter), but ever since the iPhone 4 I’ve been quietly impressed with the iPhone.</p><p>I’ll start off by saying that I prefer Android to iOS. That’s a simple fact that’s not going to change - I love the widgets and customisation available on Android, and I miss the magical “menu” button where I can configure every app in the world without ever having to enter the settings screen. But this doesn’t mean I don’t like iOS - it’s a very accomplished mobile operating system, and it’s become as successful as it is because it couldn’t be easier to use. In a sense, it’s a lot more intuitive than Android, and its optimisation with iPhone hardware makes sure that everything runs smoothly, where on Android it might not.</p><p>I also love the fact that I now have a Facebook app that works (Facebook for Android is notoriously awful, and slower than a sloth with alzheimer’s) and a good interface for my music app - one thing Apple has consistently done right down the years.</p><p>The idea of a larger screen made some scowl, others laugh; but to me, it was actually kind of important: I’d been used to having the 4-inch touchscreen on my X10, and whenever I’d used an older iPhone I found it a little cramped. Sorry Steve, but that’s one call you got wrong. With all due respect to Jobs one year on, though, he was a visionary - that’s the only word for him - and he had an incredible talent to know what the public wanted, when it would want it, and how he would make them want it.</p><p>I’ll gloss over the maps - I’ve only used them very briefly and found no problems with them for Central London and Medway, but I rarely use maps as I get trains everywhere. I will say that Google Maps definitely has a better interface but it’s a little irrelevant when you don’t need to find out where you are because a robotic woman always informs you. The real issue is the battery life. I thought my last phone was bad. This is catastrophic. Schumacher and Bolt’s hybrid lovechild couldn’t keep up with how quickly it drains if you even use it a tiny bit during the day.</p><p>But I’m not going to complain. I made a decision so that I could have a wider range of apps, more sustainable hardware and... well, that’s it, but I was always taught to list things in threes. Basically, I’m pleased with the choice I made, and Satan is probably unsure whether to laugh or cry as hell freezes.</p><p></p>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>Yesterday, Adobe launched a new family of products, called the ''Edge'' suite. There''s a huge amount of potential in this family of software, which is specifically geared at web-based designers and programmers to regain the popularity that they''ve lost in the wake of CSS3 outperforming Flash in every single way (personally I''m of the belief that although Flash is certainly inferior to CSS3, it''s still a necessity for some solutions).</p><p>Adobe embraces CSS3 in Edge Animate, a program that is used to create Flash-like animations using HTML, CSS and JavaScript alone - but more on that another time. I''ll also cover the extremely intriguing Edge Reflow and Edge Inspect another day, but for now, I''ll just stick with the lower-level apps: Code and Web Fonts.</p><p>Edge Code is a code editor developed in JavaScript, and up until yesterday was known as ''Brackets''. Yes, I hear you, you already have your code editor of choice, and why shouldn''t you? There are literally thousands of free editors out there packed full of features, so why pay for something with the Adobe label? Well, for now at least, Edge Code is completely, 100% free. It remains to be seen, but right now - as long as you sign up for the Adobe Creative Cloud - the entire Edge suite is free. So if you want to try it out, here''s the time - and there''s some interesting features.</p><p>One of the best elements of Chrome''s Developer Tools is that you can change CSS rules in your browser and see the effect that it will have on the live page. AEC includes this in its own way - by pressing Ctrl+Alt+P you can bring up the page in a browser window that is effectively running ''live'' alongside your code editing. When you change a CSS rule in Code, the page automatically updates without you having to refresh. True, it''s a minor step that''s cut out, but it''s very intuitive and it means you don''t have to remember to paste your rules back afterwards. It''s a shame that this only happens for CSS, though: it would be very nice if you could edit your HTML and immediately see your changes, too, so maybe this is a feature that could be added on final release.</p><p>You can also quickly grab the CSS rules for an element by selecting the element and hitting Ctrl+E, which brings it up in a separate inline code editor. This gets you all of the rules that are assigned to that element, from external files, the page itself and styles assigned to that element. This, too, works with the Live Preview.<br></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p></p><p>I mentioned earlier about Adobe Edge Web Fonts - this isn''t so much a standalone app as much of an integrated feature into other Edge applications. It''s fairly simple: when you''re defining a font-family CSS rule, you have the option to bring up a gallery that provides you with a bunch of free Web Fonts powered by Typekit. Select the font you want to use, then click a button that provides you with the JS link you need to put into each page you''re using the font on, and BAM! Instant web fonts.</p><p>And - I''m coming to the end of the positives for AEC now - JSLint is built in, which, when enabled, thoughtfully scans all of your code and tells you where your syntax errors are.<br></p><p></p>
</div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-09-06/edge_2.jpg"></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>So, if I''m at the end of the positives, there must be negatives, yes? Well, yes - for every brilliant feature that Edge Code leaves in, it leaves out some that many will feel are essential. The comment shortcut Ctrl+/ only works for Javascript, and even then it block comments by commenting out every single line. The find function is fairly unintuitive - it closes when you run it and then you have to press F3 or Ctrl+F to find the next instance rather than just carrying on the same search (side note: I''m yet to come across a better Find tool than that built into Notepad++). You can add files to the directory sidebar, but you can''t delete them, so if you accidentally add an empty JS file, you have to go find the directory yourself. There''s also no auto-indentation (this one''s a minor gripe, but being used to Sublime Text now, I expect all of my mistakes to be magically fixed).</p><p>But the most major annoyance I have with Edge Code is that there is NO word wrap function to be found. In many ways I have always wondered why it was a feature to have word wrap turned&nbsp;<em>off</em>, so removing it entirely feels to me to be utterly stupid.</p><p>Adobe Edge Code is a very nifty editor and I can see it having a fantastic future if these problems are fixed. Until then I''m going to be sticking to Sublime.</p><br><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

What struck me most is how well the film actually sticks to the book’s original plot without letting it become too dated. All the key plot elements are there, but just done up for the 21st century: rather than Baccarat, a game that no-one understands and not many people really play anymore, is swapped for the much more popular Texas Hold ‘em; the assassination attempt on Bond turns from a cane-gun (something much more akin to the Connery era) to poison; Le Chiffre loses all his employer’s money on the stock market, not on brothels.</p><p>The campness is gone, the testosterone is back, and it’s the best Bond since Goldeneye.</p><p></p>

I could quite easily watch a whole film just like this.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>Craig’s effortless machismo and genuine acting ability outshines his blonde hair and allows him to become Second Best Bond™. Like Dalton, he is an actor born on the stage, and, like Dalton, his theatrical style comes across in his dedication to stick to Fleming’s Bond. He’s not the infallible hero we saw in Brosnan: when he performs stunts he messes up (several times in the parkour sequence), but he is intelligent, arrogant, calm and collected, and most of all - very British, and very cold. He may not have the Bond appearance, but he’s got the personality down to a t.</p><p>The other performances, too, are just as good. Felix Leiter dispels the whole “multiple James Bond” theory by being black and indeed determining that this is a complete reboot rather than a continuation (obviously, sheesh). Then of course, there’s Ms Dench - there’s nothing to say about her that hasn’t been said a thousand times across the Internet. And finally, there’s the magnificent Eva Green, who changes Vesper’s role into a true independent woman, who cannot defend herself in a fistfight, but will almost always win in a war of words. It’s the perfect blend of being feisty without turning into an irritating feminist, and her rapport with Craig is fantastic.</p><p>But I think my favourite change from the book is Le Chiffre. In Fleming’s novel, he is just a mostly silent fat man who has a penchant for gambling. The film turns him into a typical Bondian villain - his gambling is made a lot more dramatic by his mathematical genius, and he weeps blood. He’s also a lot more charismatic. All of these traits just add to his cruelty which make the infamous torture scene seem much more evil - even if Craig does his best to lighten the mood.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Understandably there’s extra scenes to pad out the film, because if it was simply based on the book it’d be all in the Casino and end within half an hour. There’s nothing wrong with the extra scenes at all, there’s just an awful lot of them, and the film becomes too long. There’s at least three points when it feels like it should end and it doesn’t, and it begins to drag.</p><p>And the product placement does get a little annoying. The return of the Aston Martin is a welcome one, but the Sony and Virgin logos get a little tiresome. And of course there’s the little... incident... with Richard Branson.</p><p></p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Vastly, vastly different to anything before it, Chris Cornell’s powerful vocals manage to ring out a brilliant rock anthem. It compliments the title sequence perfectly, and again, updates the franchise.</p><hr><p>So Daniel Craig dragged Bond kicking and screaming into 2006 away from almost everything before it. Can the follow-up live up to the expectations set by his debut? (No.)</p><p></p><p></p>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span>I''m painfully aware that it''s been nearly three months since my last blog. It''s been a while because I have had such little time to write anything due to a combination of work, Animal Crossing and a puppy, but also because I''ve struggled to have any real inspiration for content. Animal Crossing is great and all, and I would write a blog about it, if my fucking shoulder buttons worked so I could take some screenshots.</span></p><p></p><p><span>But probably my all-time favourite band releasing a new album is inspiration for me to write something new; I thought I''d write along as I listen it through the first time, so sorry if this blog is a bit of a ramble. This is a journey, for me, for you, a journey through Trent&nbsp;Reznor''s&nbsp;totally fucked up mind: Nine Inch Nails are back with&nbsp;</span><span>Hesitation Marks</span><span>.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The album''s intro,&nbsp;</span><span>The Eater of Dreams,</span><span>&nbsp;is classic NIN in terms of the fact that it''s a lot of strange noises mangled with&nbsp;</span><span>white noise. Then the white noise drops into&nbsp;</span><span>Copy Of A</span><span>. The title alone doesn''t make any sense, but the lyrics provide a bit of context (''I am just a copy of a copy of a copy of a...'') and this is deliberately reflected in the repetitive nature of the song. The track''s main beat is only a few seconds long and is repeated continually except for in the chorus, and then other equally short and repetitive layers are gradually added, and repeated over and over. It''s fairly lengthy at nearly five and a half minutes and yet somehow it doesn''t feel too long, boring or irritating; it''s actually fairly catchy.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Came Back Haunted&nbsp;</span><span>opens equally as suddenly as&nbsp;</span><span>Copy Of A,</span><span>&nbsp;and is much closer to the With Teeth/Year Zero era - it has an electric beat with a big chorus and signature drop B tuned guitars. I like to think of this song as&nbsp;Reznor&nbsp;describing his return to NIN - ''Just can''t stop, I came back haunted''… so far, I for one am glad he can''t keep away. Slightly tangentially before the next song starts, I''ve never been a huge fan of his side project How To Destroy Angels - it''s too far removed from what I grew to love in NIN.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Find My Way&nbsp;</span><span>slows the pace from the previous two tracks, and this is another one that sounds like it could fit right in With Teeth - it''s fairly quiet and ambient, without all the weird noises of the older albums. It''s songs like this that remind me why NIN albums are best listened to as a whole album; it''s not a song I''d listen to on a whim but it fits in so perfectly with the flow and sound of the album so far that it''d be a damn shame to miss out on it.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The next track,&nbsp;</span><span>All Time Low</span><span>, is a strange one - it starts off as you''d expect, with the kind of noises you wouldn’t expect in any other genre of music, but then when it kicks in, it kicks in with a reggae-influenced beat. It''s an interesting shift in tone, because it still keeps the industrial backdrop - it sounds very experimental. It''s another typically downbeat song despite this, though: ''Hey/Everything is not okay/we''ve lost so much along the way''. It ends with a minute of what sounds like a remix of the Final Fantasy theme tune.</span></p><p></p><p><span>So far I''m not&nbsp;</span><span>Disappointed&nbsp;</span><span>with the album (sorry), but Trent''s disappointed in something - this track is another more ambient track that sounds like it''d fit right into a lonely space film like&nbsp;</span><span>Sunshine&nbsp;</span><span>or</span><span>2001: A Space Odyssey&nbsp;</span><span>if it was made in 2013 (not that that would make any sense). I think Trent''s recent movie compositions have had a direct influence on his actual music in this way.&nbsp;</span><span>At this point Yoda interrupted me on Spotify and decided to break the wall for some advertising. I have absolutely no problem in listening to ads because I''m listening to music for free, but fuck me I hate these Vodafone ads - they’re just complete bollocks. What does Yoda (or Star Wars, for that matter) have to do with cellular technology? They''re ruining one of the franchise''s most beloved characters at the same time, and... sorry, time for the next track,&nbsp;</span><span>Everything. Everything</span><span>&nbsp;is another departure from the NIN formula and sounds more like it was written by a late nineties/early 2000s Britpop band like Ash or Blur. In fact, the opening drum beat sounds remarkably similar to&nbsp;</span><span>Song 2...</span></p><p></p><p><span>Satellite</span><span>&nbsp;is slightly less experimental than the last few songs and brings the album back on course to what the first few tracks made it sound like it was going to be. This continues with&nbsp;</span><span>Various Methods of Escape.</span><span>&nbsp;I''m slightly more comfortable listening to this more traditional style of NIN song (oddly enough, as I think many people find the genre rather discomforting) but it means there''s not quite as much to write about. I have to say, though, that this is probably my favourite track on the album so far.</span></p><p></p><p><span>About two-thirds of the way through the album I''ve decided to take a break to play with Monty the miniature dachshund and I''ll pick this up again later.</span></p><p></p><p>I come back to this after three days rather than the twenty minutes I envisioned, but I''m still picking up where I left off. Although I will likely publish this about a week after it''s actually finished. (<i>edit: actually did).</i>Tangent over, the next track is&nbsp;Running. This too is closer to older NIN - really old, in fact, closer to the&nbsp;Pretty Hate Machine&nbsp;or&nbsp;Downward Spiral&nbsp;era, but without the&nbsp;shoutiness&nbsp;or the degraded quality of audio that is twenty plus years old.</p><p></p><p><span>I Would For You&nbsp;</span><span>eases you in slowly for a minute or so, and you''re just waiting for that chorus, and once it kicks in, the whole song picks up. It''s pretty chilled but still catchy as hell. The track changes&nbsp;seemlessly&nbsp;into&nbsp;</span><span>In Two,&nbsp;</span><span>which is an angry, electric song; switching tone and pace in multiple places without warning. The lyrics imply a schizophrenic (''split in two... ...it''s getting harder and harder to tell the two of you apart'') which could be symbolic to these aggressive shifts of style. The song ends as abruptly as its beginning was sudden, and&nbsp;</span><span>While I''m Still Here</span><span>&nbsp;slows the pace back down. It''s an eerily calm song about a man waiting for Armageddon and what he''s thinking while he waits. I do wonder if there''s a concept behind this album; most NIN albums do, but that''s something for another time and another few&nbsp;playthroughs.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The outro is&nbsp;</span><span>Black Noise.</span><span>&nbsp;You wouldn''t guess that the song had changed at first as it has the same main riff as&nbsp;</span><span>While I''m Still Here</span><span>, but gradually a very ominous and dark noise swallows the rest of the track. It does sound like the end of the world and it''s left me thinking there''s almost definitely some kind of story to the album. God damn, now I need to find a fan theory for an album that''s only a week old.</span></p><p></p><p><span>All in all,&nbsp;</span><span>Hesitation Marks</span><span>&nbsp;is a very good but clearly experimental album that takes bits of pieces from all of NIN''s previous work but introduces new elements that often sound out of place, but in a good way. It''s not an easy listen - at all - but this is what NIN have always been about. Although I personally love Year Zero, The Slip and With Teeth, they all had a radio-friendly quality that was distinctly and deliberately absent when the band first started. It''s not quite as heavy as it used to be, but it''s just as dark and just as dismal as ever. Vive la&nbsp;Reznor.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Tetris, BOOYAH. Oh, what do you want, Sqaure block? No-one likes you.</p>

<p>We''re all fully aware of Tetris and the way it works, so I won''t patronise you all with telling you the concept behind it. In fact, this is going to be a very short blog.</p>

<p>Tetris is pretty much what shaped me into a gamer. Hours upon hours I have played a thousand different versions, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">hallucinating in the night about the perfect game</a>, unable to get that world-famous song out of my head. Hell, when I first launched my ASP.net-based site, it was my background. Oh, and <a href="http://m.declantyson.net">my half-done mobile site</a> is a replica of the classic Tetris gameboard.</p>

Since then I''ve played versions on Windows, Linux, Playstation, Facebook, Wii... the list is probably endless, and yet the version that inevitably draws me back is the Game Boy original. Alas, my poor old-school original Game Boy and its oddly off-green screen died on me a few years back, so I''ve had to emulate the original if I wanted to play it. This, as you can imagine, is pretty pointless. But there was hope! Nintendo in their all-encompassing wisdom (not to mention their uncanny ability to make a cash farm out of everything) released the original for the 3DS Virtual Console.

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><span id="hide-background"></span><p>Every now and then there’s an awesome pack of downloadable games that gets released called the Humble Bundle. You can pay whatever you want for these - from one cent (read a halfpenny - remember those things? I sure as hell don’t) to thousands upon millions of dollars. The concept being that all funds raised go to charities, or to the humble developers of the indie games - depending on your choosing. If you beat the average spend you get a better game, to make sure that everyone doesn’t cheapo out.</p>

<p>This one happens to be the first humble bundle I’ve purchased. I paid $8 and got 5 games. It’s supposed to be an Android-based one but it’s available for PC, Mac and Linux too through the glory of Steam. One of the games is tablet-only too, so it only seemed right that I get the PC keys too. Here’s a rundown of the games that I got:</p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><h3>BIT.TRIP BEAT</h3>
<p>I actually already owned BIT.TRIP Beat in the form of one of six games of BIT.TRIP Saga for the 3DS. The basic gameplay premise is pretty much what you''d get if you combined Pong, Breakout and Guitar Hero, but instead of Rock Music, you''re mixing it up with 80''s chiptunes. You are literally on a bit trip.</p>
<p>Beat is one of the better BIT.TRIP games, a true retro experience, but on Android it just doesn''t transfer as well. It lacks a useful control system. The 3DS version allows you to use either the incredibly sensitive analog stick or the lower touch screen to control your paddle.</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/btb.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>Android version offers touch screen control and tilting using your device''s accelerometer, but neither of these control schemes really work. Using the touch screen, you''re covering up part of your playing area with your thumb and it becomes difficult to see what''s going on. And the tilt is far too sensitive - it makes the game far, far, far too difficult.</p><p>The PC version of the game fares considerably better, using the mouse to control.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/fieldrunners.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><h3>Fieldrunners</h3>
<p>There’s not an awful lot to say about Fieldrunners: it’s a standard tower defense game. If you like tower defense (and I happen to) you’ll absolutely love it. The first tower defense I ever played was <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/rstein/antbuster">Antbuster on Kongregate</a> and it sticks to the formula very well: different powered towers that you can upgrade, some slow enemies down, yadayadayada.</p>

<p>The Android version is disappointingly limited compared to the PC version, though, and it’s a little clunky to play on a touch screen - it’s annoying when you get turrets stuck behind the icons on the screen, which is a slight design flaw to say the least.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>The difficulty curve is perfect, and with the higher amount of levels on PC, it’s good fun, but with 12 levels to complete on Android the novelty wears off saddeningly quickly.</p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><h3>SpaceChem</h3><p>Initially I struggled to get the concept of SpaceChem, but as soon as you realise what it is, it couldn’t be simpler. If you’re into your science, it’s great. Myself I only have a passing interest and basic understanding of chemistry, but I enjoy the puzzle element of the game, even if the initial learning curve is a little steep.</p>

<p>I feel curiously content when making a more complicated solution, though, and although it hasn’t piqued my interest in chemical reactions at all, it’s certainly whiled away a few hours of solid, satisfying entertainment.</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/spacechem.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>The only annoying thing is that I can’t play the Android version as it requires a tablet. Understandable though really - there’s a lot going on and you’d need a decent sized screen to be able to take everything in.<br></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/uplink.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><h3>Uplink</h3>
<p>This is the game that first caught my eye in the bundle. It’s a hacker simulator, mostly text-based with a mock hacker operating system from which you can conveniently connect to any computer on the planet through an easy-to-use WIMP interface.</p>

<p>Despite its simplicity, it’s a thoroughly enjoyable game, challenging and rewarding. However, this is the sort of game that would be more well suited on a portable device. The Android version requires a tablet, which - unlike SpaceChem - I’m not sure is necessary. The interface is dead simple to use and there’s a huge amount of white space (although it’s black) even on lower resolutions.</p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>Nevertheless, you feel like a real fat man with a ponytail in his parent’s basement, and whilst it’s not something I’ll stick at for hours on end - it gets a little repetitive - I’ll come back to it for short bursts every now and then.<br></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><h3>Spirits</h3>
<p>Spirits is an artsy-fartsy version of Lemmings.</p>

<p>I don’t use that phrase in a derogatory manner; it’s visually stunning and the animations are absolutely superb. But it is artsy-fartsy, and it is identical to Lemmings in almost every way. You save “spirits” by using the abilities of other spirits. The only difference, really, lies within the physics: the spirits take the form of leaves, so they blow around a lot more than just falling to their doom like their green-haired ancestors.</p>

<p>Basically, if you like Lemmings, you’ll like this. And if you don’t like Lemmings, well, you don’t exist.</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/spirits.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr>

<p>I''m not sure if this Humble Bundle is supposed to try and garner interest for Android as a gaming platform, but unfortunately, it won''t. The simple truth is that the desktop versions of most of these games are so far superior that giving them away alongside the Android versions highlights the weakness of the mobile phone as a gaming device. The flaws I''ve highlighted are exacerbated by the fact that I''m running on a 2-year old phone that struggles to play some of the higher games.</p>

<p>Having said that, the Humble Bundle is fantastic for a number of reasons. It''s great for gamers: we can get great games, for as cheap as we want. It''s great for developers: even if the money doesn''t go to them, it goes to a good cause for charities, and it''s free publicity for them. Spaces of Play, Gaijin, Introversion, Zachtronics and Subatomic will all become much more well-known following this, and you can guarantee it''ll provide a boost to their sales. </p>

<p>Just after I finished writing this, I got an e-mail telling me that they’re now including the original Humble Bundle for Android now with HBfA 3. And anyone who’s already purchased 3 gets to download it free of charge. Amazing.</p>

<p>I''m personally looking forward to the next bundle, hopefully a bigger one - let''s wait and see...</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

</div><div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable" style=""><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><h3><b>A little bit of background</b></h3>

<p>Post 11/9 (read backwards if you’re American) it could have been said that people were beginning to lose faith in the idea of an invincible, infallible hero that defeats evil whilst getting laid and pissed off his nut. However, the producers of Die Another Day didn’t get the memo.</p>

<p>This also marked the 20th Bond film, and the 40th anniversary since Dr No. A fact which is celebrated by references to the previous 19 films. I would point them all out, but frankly I can’t be bothered. I’ll post a link when I can be bothered to someone else’s Blogalongabond that could be bothered.</p>

<p>Also, cinema was crazy-obsessed with CGI.</p>

<h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3>

<p>It starts off promsingly - Brosnan (beginning to look a little old) surfs (for some reason) into North Korea, nicks some diamonds and sets some stuff to blow up. There’s crazy North Korean generals, some east/west cold war hypocrisy references. Bond is discovered, stuff blows up, one of the main villains gets diamonds stuck in his face, they race some hovercraft, and then finally Bond is captured and tortured. It’s an above-average opening sequence - ignoring the horrific line “saved by the bell” it sets the tone for what should have been a highly entertaining film. And then if you mute Madonna, the opening credits are actually fairly haunting and impressive. A little too overdone on the CGI, perhaps, but it advances the plot, which is more than can be said for any other film in the series so far.</p>

<p>And then the credits end and it’s all downhill from there.</p>

<h3><b>What’s the best bit?</b></h3>

<p>The opening sequence is very good, I don’t think anyone can deny that: it’s 15 minutes of genuine entertainment right up until Madonna begins. And aside from that appalling piece of crap, the music is actually very good.</p>

<p>The tube scene is also good and allows Brosnan to prove that he is actually a relatively good actor, and it’s here that the script actually is pretty good - “an abandoned station, for abandoned agents” - and “while you were away, the world changed” - the only actual reference to 11/9 made in the entire film (and I think that’s probably a sensible decision, to be honest).</p>

<p>And there are some great performances. Judi Dench is a fortress. Her words could cut diamonds; her eyes pierce (no pun intended) Brosnan like needles and she shows cold and remorseless a thousand times more than Bernard Lee ever managed. Rosamund Pike is a fox, and she develops her character well enough to make her more than just eye candy.</p>
</div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-100" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/madonna.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3>

<p>The amount of CGI in the film is a joke, and it’s a bad joke at that. It all begins with that stupid CGI bullet in the gun barrel sequence - something that was never there before and hopefully will never be again. The kitesurfing sequence harps back to the days when the stuntmen didn’t even look like Roger Moore. It’s so clearly not Brosnan and it doesn’t even vaguely convince you otherwise. And the green screen is done pretty shoddily too. It looks like one of my first ever University projects.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Yet again, there’s too many celebrities with self-indulgent cameos in the film. Halle Berry is just awful and the scene where she’s introduced is so unsubtly a reference to Dr No that it just seems a little pathetic. She tries to do this whole “bad girl” image which is just annoying and she brings many innuendos which bring down the tone of what should be a serious film. Michael Madsen’s role is bordering on irrelevant and he seems to just be there to fill up their famous quota. Whilst I can’t bring myself to insult John Cleese, his Q is poor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">And then there’s Madonna. I don’t like Madonna.</span></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-100" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-20/madonna_.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>The script is pretty atrocious from beginning to end. There’s a sequence about 86 minutes in that genuinely makes me cringe.</p><i>Bond to Guy with diamonds in face: “I’ve missed your sparkling personality”<br>Guy with diamonds in face punches Bond: “How’s that for a punchline?”<br>Bond’s slag no. 3749: “I enjoyed last night, but it really is death for breakfast!”</i><p></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">But there’s one line that truly stands out for me as an example of the poorest, laziest scriptw</span><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">riting I’ve seen in any film to date. And it’s not even the “Yo mama” line.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">When Jinx and Miranda are fighting at the end, Frost says “I can read your every move!” and Jinx replies by killing her, saying “read THIS, bitch!” It’s not even that I think swearing doesn’t belong in a Bond film. Used right, you could probably drop an f-bomb so long as it’s not made a massive point out of. But this line is so Americanised, so disgustingly crass, and so bloody lazy, that it makes my stomach churn a little.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">The film is just so silly. I don’t mind it when Bond films toe the line of making sense but this film picks up the line, shoves it up its arse and squats it out for the next half a mile. Questions include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>Why can Bond stop his pulse at will?</li><li>Why is the first thing he does after escaping have a shave?</li><li>Why does the woman in lingerie not give a shit that Bond just KO’d her boyfriend?</li><li>Why would you give someone a makeover but not take out the diamonds stuck in their face before anything else?</li><li>Why would Miranda Frost only stop the swordfight AFTER Bond and Graves have destroyed the entire fencing club?</li><li>Why is there a vanishing car?</li><li>Why is there a palace made out of ice? I’m not a scientist but I’m not convinced that’s actually possible.</li><li>Whose idea was it to name a character Mr. Kil?</li><li>I know no-one can see the car, but why can nobody hear it or see the tracks it leaves in the snow?</li><li>How is the sun chasing Bond?</li><li>When did he learn to kitesurf?</li><li>How does an ejector seat flip a car the right way up?</li><li>Is it over yet?</li><li>Why doesn’t Jinx cough up loads of water when she recovers from nearly drowning?</li><li>Why is Graves dressed as a robot?</li><li>Why is he so happy he killed his father that he’s trying to impress by taking over the world?</li><li>Why is Miranda Frost wearing basically nothing (Not complaining about that one, mind you)?</li><li>Why is everything ineally stuttery slow-motion?</li><li>Why does Graves have a button on his suit that electrocutes himself?</li><li>Why does the MI6 training simulator double up as a Pierce Brosnan sex doll?</li><li>Why does Jinx like diamonds in her belly button?</li><li>Who signed off on this appalling script?</li><li>WHY IS THERE A FUCKING VANISHING CAR?</li></ul><p>Overall it’s a pretty poor way for Brozzers to end his otherwise great time as 007. Before I saw Die Another Day I knew him as the arsehole from Mrs Doubtfire. I wonder which film he regrets more?</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Oh god, it’s just beyond awful. It reeks of an aging middle-aged woman who has no talent desperately trying to make herself relevant in the world once again. Its poorness is almost a metaphor for the Bond series at this point, which desperately needed a kick up the arse after this shitpile.</p><hr><p>Casino Royale next month, and it’s going to be a massive step up.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>Until about a week ago, I''d never played a Kirby game.

Why? What''s the appeal? I mean, what the hell even IS he/she/they? Could it be the pink? I mean, when you actually think about it, Kirby is just a parasite zombie. He eats people and absorbs their abilities. And once he''s sucked your brains dry and left you as mush, he simply floats away. It''s only because of Nintendo''s tendency in their early days to develop games high on a drug that only they have access to that we accept this horrific monster as a cute, harmless ball of bubblegum.

Which is a shame really, because&nbsp;<em>Kirby''s Adventure</em>&nbsp;is a really solid game.</p><p>Graphically it''s probably one of the best that the NES has to offer (that says very little, I know) and the sound is pretty good too, albeit a little repetitive. The gameplay, too, is a little repetitive and somewhat unambitious, but it''s challenging and entertaining enough to forgive that. The only genuine criticism I can level at the mechanics is the fact that when you inhale two enemies, you get a randomly selected power - it would make more sense (Ha! Sense in a Nintendo game) and add another layer of depth if different combinations of powers gave you an entirely new power. I think - although don''t quote me on this, because as previously mentioned I''ve never played a Kirby game before - that this feature is added in a later game.</p><p><em>Kirby''s Adventure</em>&nbsp;was never going to set the world on fire - it''s a relatively standard cutesy early 90''s platformer before the genre got stale and run into the ground. But it says something that I enjoyed it just as much and spent as much time with it as I did&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 3D Land</em>. It''s certainly convinced me that it''s worth looking into other Kirby games, possibly&nbsp;<em>Kirby''s Adventure Wii</em>&nbsp;- I mean, I''ve got to have some reason to fire up the Wii again...</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>There''s not a lot of background to talk about except for the fact that Brozzers has well and truly brought Bond back to its dizzying commercial success with his engimatic blend of 90s cheese and nonchalant coldness.</p>

<p>However, I would like to dedicate this Blogalongabond to Desmond Llewellyn, AKA Major Boothroyd AKA Q, whose poignant departure from the series is made all the more emotional by the fact that he sadly passed away in a car crash shortly after filming. The man was a James Bond legend, consistent in every film he appeared in and essentially 007''s father figure. He leaves on a brilliant bit of scripting as well - powerful, evocative, showing Bond''s dependence and vulnerability. RIP Des.</p>

However, unlike TND, the ratio of good:bad is weighted towards the positive side. It''s a bit darker, the villains are better, and the actors seem much less disinterested and in tune with the script.</p><p>It does have some of the same silliness, a questionable script (with some fantastic one-liners but some horrific ones too) and the unnecessary celebrity cameos (Denise Richards should never be ANYWHERE near this series), but it also has some of the series'' best moments.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Just like every other single Blogalongabondier, I''m going to rant and rave about the fantastic opening sequence. It''s beyond brilliant. Pre-titles go on for nearly quarter of an hour but could pretty much make a film in itself; Bond goes to get some money back that someone''s nicked and does it in the way that only Bond can: blowing seven hells out of everyone and then plotting a daring escape by jumping out the window using another human being as an anchor. Then he proceeds to inadvertently cause explosions in the MI6 headquarters (that we''re actually allowed to see now!) and nicking Q''s boat, causing havoc on the Thames, through the streets of London and by the Millenium Dome. All in all it''s a very British opening sequence, down to the (now perfected) Brosnan tie-straighten and what effectively amounts to assault against a traffic warden that the red tops loved to hate.</p><p>And the music! Dear god the music! It''s just too good. David Arnold excels - not only in the opening sequence but throughout the entire film. He builds and improves on his fantastic work in TND, adding a suitably late-90s-turn-of-the-century-rock-techno vibe.</p><p>Sophie Marceau plays Elektra King, a psychopathic bitch whose only goal is... well, to be honest, I''m not exactly sure what she wants. She''s a great villain, sadistic, evil, mental, sexy, backstabbing, intelligent... yeah. I think she''s great.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-66"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/coltrane.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-33"><p>Another successful decision was the one to bring back Robbie Coltrane''s character Zukovsky. He plays a bigger role than in GoldenEye and brings his usual big-man charisma to it. I''d go as far to say that outside of Q and Judi Dench''s M, he''s my favourite recurring character in the series (yup, even better than Felix and Moneypenny).<br></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><h3>And the worst bit?</h3><p>Not all of the guest stars were good.</p><p>Unlike the perfectly executed Elektra, Renard ''The Anarchist'' is a villain who doesn''t meet his considerable potential. Maybe it''s because when I look at Rob Carlyle I just see Begby. Maybe it''s because he can''t avoid his Scottish accent. But I can''t believe that he''s a Eastern European psychopath who doesn''t feel pain due to a bullet in his brain (interesting if strange backstory). He''s a Scottish psychopath who kills people for heroin. And he always will be.</p><p>Then there''s Denise Richards. Frankly, the less said about her the better, but I''m going to rant about her. At length. Her acting is stale, boring and when she''s on screen I can''t wait for her to leave and Sophie to come back again. She''s even worse than Teri Hatcher in TND. At least they attempted to give Paris Carver a little bit of character, but Doctor Christmas Jones (who honestly came up with that name? Was it just to include the closing line ''I thought Christmas only comes once a year''? It''s OK, but it''s certainly no ''cunning linguist'') is literally just a bunny boiler who dresses inexplicably like Lara Croft. She''s not a Tomb Raider, she''s a nuclear scientist, and we all know Bond''s impression of female scientists, so why this glaringly obvious and ultimately pointless popular cultural reference?</p><p>And then there''s the worst offender. Goldie (character name ''Bullion'', trying to emulate his already stupid alias). Even worse than Denise Richards. He''s apparently a ''musician'' so why he''s trying to act in the first place is beyond me. Except it turns out, that in addition to his music and acting being terrible, he became known as a graffiti artist. If Banksy turns up in a Bond film, all hell will break loose.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Forgettable. In all honesty, it''s pretty dire. Garbage may be an artist but it''s a suitably apt description. Although because I was born on the correct side of the Atlantic, perhaps I should refer to it as ''rubbish''. Although ''shit'' would be better still.</p><hr><p>That''s the peak of Brozzers finished. Are you ready for the pit?</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p><span class="first">W</span>hilst looking for a holiday, neither my girlfriend or I had any particular desire to head out to Turkey. It wasn''t for any particular reason, there was just nothing that appealed to us that much. And yet every single person we had spoken to that had been there had nothing but praise for the entire country. We listened well upon their advice and researched into the destination a bit more and ended up deciding to go, thinking that so many people could not be wrong. And wrong they were not - our trip to Sarigerme was joyful in every respect, and I''m struggling to find fault with anything there.</p>

<p>Although the town of Sarigerme is small and somewhat quiet, the main reason we chose this resort is the proximity to some of southwest Turkey''s best attractions, with many excursions available at very reasonable prices (and cheaper than TUI) from several fully insured, honest and friendly tour companies in the town. If you read TripAdvisor reviews (and you should, because it''s one of the handiest travel websites I''ve ever come across) for hotels in that area, you''ll find Basket Tours mentioned time and time again, and they''ve got a big presence in the town, so keep them in mind when booking excursions further afield.</p>

<p>The excursions that we chose to go on included visiting a turtle sanctuary, which rehabilitated ill or injured turtles that nest upon the nearby beaches, and taking a boat down the Dalyan river providing stunning views and a chance to see ancient tombs carved into the sides of mountains. We had a traditional Turkish bath, which is a fairly spectacular affair -  after taking a sauna you are washed and then scrubbed down, before your masseurs soak a pillowcase in soapy water and squeeze it out over you, so you''re covered in bubbles for a few minutes before being rinsed off, leaving your skin cleaner than it''s ever been. That wasn''t the only pampering we gave our skin, though - we had a mud bath just off the banks of the Dalyan, covering our skin with clay and leaving it to harden in the sun. Not exactly sure what the benefit of this is, but apparently it''s good, and it was a great laugh either way.</p>

<p>And although Sarigerme itself wasn''t the best town in the world, the nearby town of Dalyan and the relatively close city of Fethiye both provided options to explore Turkey a little bit and experience Turkish markets and the east-meets-west culture that the country is famous for. Perhaps a little ignorantly I assumed that the culture of Turkey - being predominantly Muslim - would be similar to the attitudes that I saw in Egypt: that women would be kept out of sight at all times, that they would make comments and pay obsessive attention to my girlfriend because of her blonde hair, that they would be difficult to shake off should we ever get into a conversation with them. But this isn''t the case at all. They call themselves a "modern country", because they give everyone the choice to choose their religion and how devoted they are to it, they aren''t pushy people and (mostly) take no for an answer, and as a result the atmosphere''s a lot less intimidating. It''s a cross between a European country and a Middle-Eastern country, with flavours of Asia thrown in there too.</p>

<p>On top of this we also went on a Jetski, a speedboat visiting the outlying islands in the Mediterranean (including an island called Rabbit Island - I made a joke about it only having one rabbit because of the name, but when we arrived we did actually only see one rabbit) and of course soaked up the beautiful 45°+ heat daily whilst you suckers were stuck in the rain back here in England.</p>

<p>I''ll round off by talking about one thing I love: food. Whilst the food in Egypt was not-too-bad at best and questionable most of the time, Turkey''s food was consistently brilliant. The hotel we stayed at had a hut dedicated to cooking traditional Turkish pancakes on a hot stone, which were the best pancakes I''ve ever had. Hell, I don''t even normally like pancakes that much, but these were something else. In Turkey - again, it''s a modern country - you can find most of the food that you''d eat in a Western country, so if you aren''t a fan of the Turkish cuisine you can always go get a curry. But Turkish food is various meats grilled in spices, or grilled fish. I love grilled food no end, so I was always going to be pleased, but even so it surpassed my expectations. One night they were cooking live crayfish in front of us in garlic and herbs, and they were so damn fresh and tasty - it was out-of-this-world awesome.</p>

<p>The thing about Turkey - and the reason it wasn''t our initial choice of holiday destination - is that there''s no one single thing about it that stands out. But everything, and I mean everything, is so amazing, that there''s no way I''d question going back again.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Other', N'I took a holiday to Turkey this year and it was fantastic.', N'turkey, holiday, sarigerme, dalyan, dalaman, fethiye, turtle sanctuary', '20120723 13:42:55', '20131121 13:42:55', 1, 1)

Are they in the top 4? Definitely not” (despite what FIFA think, having named England as 4th best in the world today). We were completely outplayed by a fantastic Italian performance and we will never, ever win on penalties (we were lucky once, never again). There were many shaky moments, and as ever watching my country play their national sport is like a form of torture dreamt up in the furthest pits of hell, but there were highlights: Andy Carroll’s coming of age as he showed passion in playing for his national team that he never showed at Liverpool being a highlight for me. I’m pleased with Hodgson and some of our youngsters proved that they could perform on the big stage.

<p>1997: Rupert Murdoch ruled the world and the English had just given control of Hong Kong over to the Chinese. James Bond arrives on the scene to put both China and Murdoch in their place. </p>

<h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3>

<p>Erm... no. Well, to say it’s bad would be doing it a massive injustice as in parts it’s very entertaining. But it suffers from an incessantly stupid plot, a script that would fit in better to the Bond of the Moore era, and a monotonous cast who - Judi Dench and Jonathan Pryce aside - sound like they’d rather be anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Pryce plays the utterly ridiculous character of Eliot Carver fairly well, to his credit. He really gives the impression that he actually enjoys using the catchphrase “delicious”, and that he really would make China and Britain go to war over some newspapers. So he was a good casting decision.</p>

<p>A bad casting decision, however, is Teri Hatcher. Bond girls aren’t supposed to be famous. The producers go on to make the same mistake twice more before realising that it makes the characters unbelievable, irritating and downright dislikable. </p>

<h3><b>What’s the best bit?</b></h3>

<p>The opening sequence is again fantastic. It’s a fantastic set piece from start to finish (although when Bond gave up smoking I’m not sure). Judi Dench again kicks ass in putting stuffy old military generals in their place. In fact, she excels throughout the entire film in a much more developed role than in Goldeneye. There are more explosions in this one scene than there are in many of Michael Bay’s most explosive films. It’s just a shame it all gets a little ridiculous when 007 starts flying the plane with his knees. In fact, Brosnan’s first three lines are all Moore-like quips, adequately setting the (low) tone for the rest of the film.</p>

<p>Desmond Llewellyn yet again proves he is the only man on the planet cooler than James Bond. The gadgets are a little over-the-top, but I think it’s one of the redeemable features of this film, as their ridiculousness isn’t quite as bad as other ones, such as Die Another Day.</p>

<p>Aside from that, the zinger line “cunning linguist” - which totally escaped me at 8 years old - from Moneypenny truly made me laugh. Quite possibly the best one-liner in the entire series.</p>

<h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3>

<p>Teri Hatcher, BMW instead of Aston, the stupid story, the terrible script, the (mostly) atrocious acting. There’s far too many cheesy one-liners. The plot often develops in ways that don’t make a lot of sense, like when Bond willingly goes to what he MUST know to be a beating, just so he can turn off a television broadcast.</p>

<p>All of these, I could forgive, if it wasn’t for one massive plot flaw. When Carver dies - ripped apart by a remote-controlled drill torpedo (yeah, you did read that right) - he has a good 20 seconds where he could have run away from it, instead of watching his impending doom running right towards him and simply letting it happen. So this man - one of the most powerful and intelligent men in the world - is not smart enough to MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OF AN ENORMOUS DRILL.</p>

<h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3>

<p>It’s a bit warbly, and a sounds a bit like Sheryl Crow was being held at gunpoint whilst she was singing it. It is accompanied by a fantastic, if a little odd, image sequence, which has an X-Ray theme, completely irrelevant to the rest of the film. Oh, and there’s some Diamonds thrown in there for good measure. Because to be honest, this film is on a similar level to Diamonds Are Forever.</p><p>

</p><p>The score as a whole, though, is excellent, and the techno-infused beats are worked better than they were in Goldeneye. </p>
<hr>
<p>Well, so far in Brosnan’s era we’ve had good-bad. Hint for the next two films: this is a pattern.</p>

<p><i>This is a spoiler-filled review of the first two seasons of Game of Thrones. If you haven''t watched them, look away now! If you''ve only watched the first, <a href="http://declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=42&amp;catid=3"></a><a href="/game-of-thrones-s1">maybe this will interest you</a>.</i></p>

<p><span class="first">B</span>etween watching the two seasons so far of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">The Most Epic TV Series Ever Made</span>, I''ve read the first three novels in the Song of Ice and Fire. This allowed me to notice an awful lot of differences between A Clash of Kings and Game of Thrones: Season 2. Most of it is relatively minor, but then you come across a ridiculously massive change such as Danerys'' dragons getting nicked. In fact, the whole storyline in Qarth is entirely different to the novel''s version.</p>

<p>This in itself isn''t a bad thing. It threw me out at first, but it allowed me to watch the game unfold with the same vivid addiction as the first series, as I was never quite sure which way the producers would take it. In fact, it gives Danerys'' chapters more vision and purpose, as in the book she wanders into the House of the Undying of her own free will out of curiosity. Her dragons are never stolen, the thirteen are not brutally murdered by Pyat Pree the freaky-deaky wizard, and the House of the Undying seems even more like some kind of weird Milk of the Poppy trip.</p>

<p>But it''s not just the changes that were good. The Battle of the Blackwater couldn''t have been done better, in my view - it was the best scene in A Clash of Kings and to dedicate a whole episode to it was absolutely the right thing to do. Stannis, Melisandre and Davos have been perfectly cast, and Jack Gleeson''s portrayal of Joffrey as the biggest arsehole in the entire world is sublime. He gets all the subtle nuances just right, from his undeserved smugness and arrogance down to his childish fear when under mild threat. Similar is to be said of Archie Allen''s display as Theon Greyjoy, the naive boy who betrayed his friends and de facto family in order to impress his biological family, who turn their back on him. Every expression Allen pulls shows his inner conflict, and he''s fantastic.</p>

<p>And of course there''s the Lannisters. I can''t say anything about Tyrion that everyone else hasn''t already said. He is amazing, and Peter Dinklage is just spectacular. Lena Headey also comes into herself as she has a bigger role this time round, playing the increasingly mad Cersei. And then there''s Tywin. Tywin plays rather a bit part in the books, he''s mentioned lots and seen little. But Greg Spence &amp; co have really developed his character here in interesting back-and-forth scenes with Arya. He''s a not entirely unkind man, it would seem - very intelligent, with a bit of love in his heart still... somewhere.</p>

<p>I could go on all day reciting how awesome every character and actor is. I haven''t even touched the Starks. I know many were worried that without Ned Stark the whole series would fall apart but on the contrary, although killing off the main protagonist was a very bold move, it provides motivation for nearly all of the other characters and doesn''t lack anything for it.</p>

<p>Overall the second season - much like the second book - isn''t as consistently gripping as the first, but although its high points are less frequent, they''re considerably higher. I could watch the wildfire on the Blackwater for eternity. And the best part is, I know that the next season will be sensational.</p>

Why doesn’t he get it over with by buying a zimmer frame and shout at kids to get off his lawn?” Well, shut up. I complain because I’m right. And <b>The Letter V Six Times</b> is also right. So very, very, very, very, very, very right. (See what I did there?)</p>

<p>VVVVVV, The Letter V Six Times, or The Noise You Make When Trying To Impersonate A Motorbike, is essentially a C64 game packaged in a neat little £7.20 digital download for your 3DS, PC or Mac. And this is pretty much a demand: buy it.</p>

<p>The game is simple. You control a pixelated spaceman, platforming your way through a pixelated world, and à la Sonic the Hedgehog 1, every button you press does the exact same thing. Unlike Sonic, though, you don’t jump, you flip the gravity. So you’re either floating up, or falling down, until you land. There’s two options when you land: you’ve hit a platform and are ready to take on the next challenge, or you’ve hit something else and you’re dead. Chances are it’s the latter.</p>

<p>That''s right, in a generation where games are becoming progessively easier, VVVVVV is actually hard. Like, really hard. Be prepared for some inventive cursing, moments of soul-crushing frustration and to rue the day you became a gamer. But it''s all worth it for when you reach the next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief, where you finally let out your breath and feel a wave of achievement wash over you. In that sense, VVVVVV is the most satisfying game I''ve ever played.</p>

<p>Stylistically, the game is exactly what I enjoy. The chiptunes are catchy, the graphics clear, bright and simple and the whole feel of the game is wonderfully nostalgic, right down the name given to each of the rooms at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>By the time you''ve reached the end of the game you might be feeling a little underwhelmed by its relatively short length, especially seeing as you''ve been victimised by the game''s criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls. But it doesn''t end there. There''s additional "player levels" which made it into the bundle, which are <b>even harder</b>, and as a result intensely more enjoyable.</p>

<p>I''ve not ranted too much about the downfall of videogames in this blog, because VVVVVV <i>is</i> a modern game. It''s just taken a step in the right direction.

It''s actually a pretty difficult process, and took me a while to find a solution that worked, so I thought I''d share it here for everyone.</p>

<p>The short answer is to use the free PHP class, HTML2FPDF. But this is a lot more complex than it sounds. So here''s a very brief tutorial.</p>
<p><i>Note: a basic understanding of PHP is required to be able to follow this tutorial.</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.declantyson.net/assets/fpdf17.zip">this archive</a> and unzip it into the root directory of your website (htdocs, wwwroot, whatever).</li>
<li>Edit the file <b>pdf-dl.php</b> using your favoured editor (mine is Notepad++). This file is commented, and generates the actual PDF file layout.</li>
<li>On the page from you wish to generate your PDF, input a standard HTML form. Here''s one that will be valid with the supplied pdf-dl.php:
<br>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#dedede;font-family:''courier new'', monospace;font-size:12px;">
&lt;form action="/pdf-dl.php" method="post" name="pdfForm"&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="hidden" name="title" value="&lt;?php echo $title; ?&gt;"/&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="hidden" name="data" value="&lt;?php echo $content; ?&gt;"/&gt;<br>
&lt;div style="float:left;width:100px;padding:5px;height:200px;"&gt;Name:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E-mail
address:&lt;/div&gt;<br>

&lt;input type="text" name="email"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit details and download the PDF"/&gt;<br>
&lt;/form&gt;<br>
</div>
</li>
<li>Make sure that your <b>$content</b> variable contains code that won''t conflict with the pdf-dl.php. This includes changing all double quotes to single quotes. Quickest way to do this is with the following line:
<br>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#dedede;font-family:''courier new'', monospace;font-size:12px;">
$content=str_replace(''"'',"''",$content);
</div>

<p>It goes without saying that I''m slightly disgruntled about this.</p>
<p>As outlined in last year''s Premiership summary, I hate Manchester City. This comes down to a variety of reasons (was a boyhood United supported, a lifelong Gillingham supporter, and just pretty much hate everything that they represent) but it''s difficult to deny that they are deserved champions. Their football, at times, has been phenomenal, and similarly to last year, they dominate my best 11.</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-25"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/teamoftheseason_2012.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-75"><p>I''ve been championing Joe Hart as England''s no. 1 for about 5 years now, and I''m glad to see him finally get that spot. He has an incredible presence and confidence around the goal that our previous goalkeepers (David James and Rob Green, most notably) severely lacked. However, we''ve seen the emergence of a new Premier League star in Michel Vorm - the Dutch international has had a spectacular season, and with Swansea continuing to be in the Premier League next year, I''m sure his form will continue.</p><p>In defence, I struggle to see a better defender in the world than Vincent Kompany right now. Oversized forehead aside, he''s been vital to City''s winning ways - a more solid defender you couldn''t ask for. Alongside him I''ve placed the marvellously reliable Coloccini and the upcoming superstar Kyle Walker - mark my words, this guy''s going to be as big as Ashley Cole one day.<br></p><p>I''ve opted for a 3-4-3 formation, as there are simply too many options for me to put in midfield and attack, and there are at least three players I''d like to have included but I can''t. So in midfileld I’ve put the sensational Yaya Toure and David Silva, who I think are the two best players in the league right now, alongside the only Manchester United to make the cut, Antonio Valencia, and Gareth Bale, who has had another storming season - Tottenham will do well to hold on to him.<br></p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>And up front, of course, you have to have Robin Van Persie, who has had yet another brilliant season, scoring 30 goals in the Premiership alone, single-handedly dragging Arsenal kicking and screaming into the Champion’s League. I thought when Sergio Aguero signed for City at the beginning of the season he’d have a massive impact, but I didn’t quite predict it would be an injury-time goal on the final day to win them the title (as much as I despise them, that was an amazing end to the season, and will probably never be matched in terms of drama!) and Demba Ba, who, although tailed off with the arrival of his compatriot Papiss Cissé, couldn’t stop scoring in the first half of the season.</p><p>We can’t ignore Papiss Cissé, though - 13 goals in 14 games must be some kind of record, and it’s that kind of determination that’s been symbolic of Newcastle’s season: attack, attack, attack. So he makes my sub’s bench, along with Vorm, Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen, and Chelsea’s Ramires, both of whom have had good seasons in relatively disappointing campaigns for both teams.</p><p>Predictions for next season? Eden Hazard will end up in England, RVP will end up in Spain, Bale will move to a new club (possibly City, I don’t think he’ll go abroad) and we’ll do abysmally in the Euros. Although I’ve got considerably higher hopes for our olympic chances.</p><p>But hey, even if we do terribly, I’ll never stop being a passionate, desperate supporter of my country, and I’m sure there’ll be some controversy or excuse for us to blame it on. BRING ON POLAND AND UKRAINE!</p><p></p>

</div><div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable" style=""><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><h3><b>A little bit of background</b></h3>

<p>Possibly because of the higher certificate, Licence to Kill seriously underperformed at the box office. Which is ridiculous. This, coupled with various legal disputes, meant that it was 6 years before the next James Bond film, and Timothy Dalton grew a bit bored, buggering off to do some Shakespeare or whatever.</p>

<p>He was replaced by someone previously shortlisted for the role, some Irish guy who played a detective or something in some kind of TV series, a one Mr. Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan is very much a middle-of-the-road Bond in my views. Whilst all of the other Bonds excel in one particular area, but perhaps lack in others (Connery: Suave, Lazenby: Physicality, Moore: Wit (this one''s debatable), and Dalton: Seriousness) Brosnan displays all of these attributes, if not to the same level of expertise. This is definitely a good thing though, as we can sit back and watch the film without worrying that when there''s an opportunity for a one-liner, it won''t be missed, but at the same time, when Bond needs to be pissed off, he can be pissed off. He can believably hold his own in a fight, but unlike Lazenby, his acting talent isn''t worse than a dead pheasant.</p>

<h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3>

<p>Maybe it''s the nostalgia. It was the first Bond I ever watched, and I was instantly hooked. Having read some of the other reviews so far, it seems to be the general consensus that it wasn''t as good as they remembered it to be. However, watching it back today, I have to disagree.</p>

<p>GoldenEye is not only the very best Bond film, it''s the best god damn film of all time. And you can quote me on that.</p>

<h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3>

<p>So a good Bond film has to start with a good villain. And for this we have three of the best in the whole series. Xenia Onatopp, who literally gets off from homicide, releasing orgasmic groans every time she fires her weapon (giggity) or crushing someone between her thighs during sex. General Arkady Gregorovic Ouromov, Head of Space Division. A man who as a child taught me that most Russians were insane psychopath miltants. And last but definitely not least, the inimitable Sean Bean, who as always delivers the manliest performance ever. His back and forth with 007 in the opening sequence is amazing (<i>''Closing time James, last call!'' ''Buy me a pint!''</i>). In fact, the entire opening sequence is pure brilliance. Bean he also has the honour of delivering the fantastic line <b>''In 48 hours you and I will have more money than God''</b>, just one of thousands of quotable lines in this gem-laden script.</p>

<p>The supporting characters are also fantastic. Judi Dench comes in as M and gives the character a damn good kick up the arse. She immediately puts Bond in his place and brings more depth to the role than any of her male predecessors, commanding more respect and showing more humanity. There''s a good reason this lady is a Dame. Desmond Llewellyn (Q) also gets a considerable amount of screentime (although not as much as LTK) as his character begins to be more prevelant in the Brosnan era. He seems to get on better with Bond than he used to, and the whole scene is thoroughly entertaining. Boris Grischenko is another insane Russian (no shortage of them in this series, is there?) whose catchphrase ''I AM INVEENCIBULL'' is a brilliant one. We have Robbie Coltrane in his pre-Hagrid days portraying another... insane Russian. And Natalya is a pretty standard Bond girl.</p>

<p>And let''s not forget about the <b>TANK</b>. Bond drives a motherflippin'' tank through St. Petersburg, tearing up the whole place. Possibly the best part about it is the fact that there''s very little hint to it happening. It''s literally only 10 seconds before the chase takes place we have any indication, as Bond tries in vain to chase Ouromov on foot, we swing the camera round to see the behemoth of a vehicle, and we have just enough time to think ''No... surely not'' before it smashes through a wall to the Bond theme blasting out at its apex.</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-100" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/TANK.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>But there''s one thing, one incredible thing that came from this film, that changed the face of another industry forever.<br></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66"><p></p><h3>The Game</h3><p>Now''s not the time or place to discuss how influential or good this game was, but it was. And the film might not have been as influential, but it was just as bloody good.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/ge64.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>There''s only one flaw with this film. What if Timothy Dalton had stuck it out and decided to play Bond in this movie? I only think he didn''t because he knew it would be too much awesome for our simple little minds to take and might cause the whole universe to collapse under the weight of how indescribably incredible it could have been.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Tina Turner bashes out another Bond classic, up there with my favourites - it''s not quite as much to my tastes as some of the other recent entries, but there''s a catchiness about it that just keeps it in your head, and coming out of your mouth after drinking a little too much Vodka from Ouromov''s hip flask (hey, when in Russia, do as the Soviets do!).</p><hr><p>So that''s the best film ever. Everything else in your life that follows will be a disappointment. Sorry about that.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>When you hear the word “bastard” in the first 5 seconds of a Bond film, you know you’re in for something different.</p>

<p>In The Living Daylights, Timothy “God” Dalton proved that he had what it takes to take Bond to the level that it needed to. It was just the right side of sinister whilst retaining all of the right elements that made it not just a film, but a Bond film. Combine this with certain key factors: the Cold War was officially over by the time of its release, and American big-budget action thrillers (notably Die Hard and Lethal Weapon) were doing the rounds at the box office, and you have the most hardcore 007 outing to date.</p>

<h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3>

<p>Absolutely fantastic. This is the film Diamonds Are Forever could have, should have been: an angry, disillusioned Bond runs riot in cold-blooded revenge with no motivation except to avenge his friend. Taking down a mass-murdering drug dealer in the process is just a convenient and fortunate side-effect.</p>

<p>There’s a bit of swearing, the fake blood budget is marked up generously, and the darker themes give it something no Bond film has been given before or since, a 15 certificate. (This will probably be rescinded to a 12 upon the Blu-ray release, it’s not actually that bad by modern day standards).</p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><h3><b>What’s the best bit?</b></h3><ul><li>Timothy Dalton. There is no better actor to play Bond; and arguably no better actor in the world. When he discovers Della and Felix’s bodies, his reaction is incredibly believable: his cry of “Della!” followed by a face of grief, followed by the jittering rage that pulses through his body when he reads that amazing note: “He disagreed with something that ate him”.</li><li>THAT stunt with the truck</li><li>“He was married once, but it was a long time ago”</li><li>Felix being fed to the shark. It’s SUCH a drastic change of tone to the series, and an indication of the film - and Dalton’s role - being closer to Fleming’s idea than the flimsy cheese that Moore output. Incidentally, though, in the novels it actually happened in Live and Let Die, which was the second book in the series. Up to this point Felix had appeared in seven films, so he’s actually done pretty well for himself.</li><li>Bond finally stands up for himself against M, and unlike On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Moneypenny isn’t there to sort it out. So instead of a boring half hour on top of a ski slope, we spend an exciting hour and a half blowing up half of a stereotyped Latin America.</li><li>“Compliments of Sharky!” It’s not the line that makes this brilliant, just the fact that Bond - surrounded by armed guards - has the balls and the anger to get revenge there and then, with no thought to anything else.</li><li>Q’s role in the film reminds you it’s still 007, and Desmond Llewellyn provides us with a little comic relief as the grandfather-like figure who deeply cares about Bond.</li><li>Bond’s double take at Pam Bouvier when she walks in all scrubbed up. The latin guitar sting just adds to it.</li><li>The iguana.</li><li>Sanchez is an interesting villain - apart from conforming to certain Latin stereotypes (“you got big cojones”, is a cocaine dealer) - and just an all round bastard.</li><li>”Watch the birdie, you bastard.”</li><li>Head explosion. ‘nuff said.</li></ul><p>I could go on all night, because pretty much every part of this film is amazing.</p><p></p>

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span class="first">I</span> have to admit that I was amongst the majority that had never heard of Pit or Kid Icarus before <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>. The two games prior to the latest installment, released on the NES and Game Boy respectively, went relatively unnoticed compared to Nintendo''s other flagships. Despite this, the latest outing in the series was pretty much the game that made me want a 3DS, and it''s lived up to the expectations that I set it.</p>

<p><i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i> is a frantic, fast-paced and brilliantly entertaining action game, with the old mantra "simple to learn, impossible to master" at the forefront throughout the entire game. However, the first thing I recommend doing when you boot up the software is changing the controls, as using the touch screen to aim gives you cramp within a few minutes. I use A/B/Y/X but I can imagine that the Circle Pad Pro is pretty well suited to this game.</p>

<p>Each level is split into three distinct sections: an on-rails air level akin to <i>Lylat Wars</i>, an on-foot level and a boss, which can be either of the aforementioned. Both of these are equally challenging, but the parts where you are not restricted by a flight path are considerably more fun, which is good, as they are invariably the longer parts of the level. The multiplayer takes place all on foot and is a great blast, adding more longevity to what is already a surprisingly big game.</p>

<p>The graphics design and game features, if not done by the Brawl team, are heavily influenced by it. The menu is nigh on identical and half of the options are directly lifted from that game. There''s also a very deep weapon customisation system that''s very much like a fantasy version of that found in <i>Borderlands</i>.</p>

<p>Although the gameplay can be a little repetitive, it never stops being fun, and although the anime take on Greek mythology coupled with odd Japanese humour may put off some people, I personally find it quite endearing.</p>

<li>When a visitor arrives at the site, it must prevent cookies from being set, unless the visitor has already indicated their consent for cookies.</li>
<li>It must present the visitor with information about the cookies the site uses, and their purpose.</li>

<p>This will be damaging for several reasons. For example, many sites will store a cookie recording the user''s first visit to the site, and give the user a personalised welcome or special message. When this law comes into effect, this will no longer be possible. It''s a minor point but one that detriments user experience. And do you want to have to click a button to allow cookies on every single site you try to visit? It again makes the user experience poorer. Cookies are often central to a site''s functionality, and so proceeding without cookies may be impossible. Many people who are unaware of what cookies are and what they do may be frightened when they are confronted with the option, and so choose to proceed without them. This is a large chunk of the market that will not experience a website as fully as they are supposed to.</p>

<p>And possibly the biggest point of all is that cookies are central to Google Analytics, the web''s most popular website analytic application.

Timothy Dalton is, for a number of reasons, the best actor to play Bond to date. His darker, more aggressive Bond is closer to Fleming''''s original incarnation. His classical acting training allows him to display more emotion than just the occasional eyebrow wiggle.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;"></span></p><p>He wasn''t nearly 60 at the time of filming, so he does most of his own stunts and the girls are closer to his own age. He brings a much harder edge to Bond that was missing in the Connery and Moore eras - ''Stuff my orders'', ''if he fires me I''ll thank him for it'', and many more anti-authority quotes to come in Licence to Kill. And yet, he retains all of the good aspects of the other Bonds - he''s physical like Lazenby, he''s suave like Connery, and he''s entertaining like Moore.</p><p>All in all, for me, Timothy Dalton IS James Bond.</p><p></p><h3><b style="line-height: 1.45em;">So, is it any good?</b></h3>

<p>If The Living Daylights had Roger in it still (ignoring the fact that he''d be another two years older) it''d probably be pretty average, but what Dalton brings to the table is so much Moore (sorry...). It''s still pretty cheesy in a lot of places, and the story, whilst vastly superior to that of the last four, doesn''t quite hit the dizzying heights of From Russia With Love or Goldfinger.</p>

<p>Having said that, John Glen''s direction is so much better this time around - the bits that are supposed to be funny actually ARE funny. The best example of this is right at the beginning, when Bond is shot in a training exercise in the pre-title sequence, only to ignore it and carry on running after an evil assailant. The guard who shot him shouts after him ''''Ere, ''old on, you''re dead!'' This is a proper example of comic relief: when comedy is provided in these more action-packed, serious situations, as opposed to a vagina pun with a raised brow.</p>

<p>And, for the first time in ten years, it''s actually about spies! Not space, smugglers or horses - spies. You know, that thing that James Bond is. A SPY.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that The Living Daylights is a bloody, bloody good film.</p>

<h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3>

<p>Well, where to start? The Living Daylights is studded with fantastic sequences, moments, fights, and Dalton brilliance.</p>

<p>My personal favourite bit - not a bit, as such, rather a relationship - is the back-and-forth between Bond and Saunders throughout the film. It goes from mutual dislike to complete hatred to respect to actually quite liking eachother. And when Saunders dies, the emotion Dalton displays is a mixture of grief and rage - something which causes him to POP A BALLOON (like a boss) before frightening a small child. In all seriousness, this sort of genuine emotion has never been shown by 007 before and it gives him a much more human side. None of the other actors could have pulled it off as well as Dalton does.</p>

<p>I chuckled when the Minister of Defence was upset that MI6 was ''the laughing stock of the intelligence community!'' because I basically heard ''All of the other boffs are bullying us!''</p>

<p>Necros is possibly my favourite henchman outside of Red Grant, and they''re both very similar - massive, blonde, hench, able to perfectly recreate any accent, and always intimidating. His fight scene with the unnamed MI6 guard is one of the best in the series, and the sound of The Pretenders will forever keep me on my toes, else I be strangled with headphones and blown up with explosive milk bottles (just the right side of a silly but cool gadget).</p>

<p>And whilst we''re on the subject of silly but cool, the cello-sledging sequence is just that. It''s a brilliant piece of cinema, packed with both adrenaline and entertainment, and it follows from one of, if not the very, <a href="http://www.i-flicks.net/blogalongabond/3190-blogalongabond-the-living-daylights-1987">best driving sequences</a> in not only the Bond series, but any film ever.</p>

<p>Uncharted 3 pretty shamelessly rips off the latter half of this film - and for good reason - because it''s awesome. The group of men on horseback that rescue Drake is obviously the Mujahideen, and when Drake hangs out the back of a Cargo plane by a massive rope net - maybe it was just a tiny bit influenced by The Living Daylights and its brilliant climax?</p>

<h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3>

<p>The only proper issue with this film is the villains. Triple-crossing, cowardly Georgi Koskov is a pathetic excuse for a man. Brad Whittaker is even worse - an American with a god complex, who owns a waxwork gallery of historical military leaders - all with his face. His arrogance isn''t even subtle. It''s lucky that diabolical Necros makes up for them both.</p>

<p>We didn''t just wave goodbye to Moore in this film, but also one of the series'' staple actresses - Lois Maxwell played her last role as Miss Moneypenny in A View To A Kill, and her replacement Caroline Bliss is pretty awful. She''s younger, and hotter, yes, but she doesn''t take to the role at all, and when Samantha Bond replaces her in GoldenEye, it''s a welcome relief.</p>

<p>Also, the Trans-Siberian pipeline that transports people from Slovakia to Austria in thirty seconds is a little too ridiculous for my liking, especially when the undercover attendant manning it distracts the supervisor by shoving his face in her tits. I thought we''d left Roger Moore.</p>

<h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3>

<p>I love 80''s music. Really I do. But I think A-Ha aren''t a great example of it. Take On Me is great, as is The Sun Always Shines On TV, but other than that, they''re just not that good. And neither is the theme tune to The Living Daylights, and it''s a shame, because it has so much potential. It''s very well mixed throughout the film by the superb John Barry Orchestra, though, and although it''s a shame to see Barry bow out of the Bond films, he does it in fine fashion - even making a cameo appearance as a conductor in the film''s final scene.</p>

<p>So we''re halfway through Timmy D''s reign as 007. So far it''s been brilliant. Licence to Kill next month.</p>

<p><span class="first">R</span>oma is a city of beauty: every building lining the cobbled streets display an aura of beauty, with their wooden shutters and pastel colours showing the,simplicity of time gone by.</p>

<p>The Fontana di Trevi is a marvel to behold, both at day and at night, although perhaps even more so when it first gets turned on after cleaning early in the morning. The water tumbles elegantly down the white marble sculptures and at that time - before all the tourist groups and street vendors come in - it''s incredibly tranquil.</p>

<p>The Colosseum and Roman Forum are both, quite simply, epic, and as you wander around their ruins and climb the Palatine hill you find yourself with a morbid curiosity about the fights they had - what does a dying gladiator look like, and who would win between a lion and a bear?</p>

<p>The Italians of today live almost as extravagantly as their ancestors. They take their food seriously: everything is cooked to perfection, with only the best ingredients, and simple is better: foccacia is not the bloated pizza dough it is here, rather a thin round bread drizzled in oil and covered in Rosemary. Pizza has a maximum of three toppings, one of those being tomato and another often cheese; and yet every flavour is richer and better than anything I''ve ever eaten in England.</p>

<p>I also had the best Ice Cream of my life from Il Gelato di San Crispino, just round the corner from the Trevi Fountain.</p>

<p>We discovered on the first day that Rome is a relatively small city; so after exploring the sites listed above (and the equally impressive Spanish Steps and Pantheon) all on foot, we walked to the Vatican City on the second day. You don''t need to be a Catholic or even a Christian to appreciate how breathtaking St. Peter''s Basilica is, and it''s well worth the climb to the top of the dome to see the whole of Rome in all its spleandor. After making our way back down the (very) narrow and slanted staircases, we made our way through the Vatican museums - not my personal cup of tea - but worth it when you arrive at the Sistine Chapel, which has quite simply the most amazing paintings I''ve ever seen. 3D tv has nothing on this, all of the paintings pop out of the ceilings without the need for stupid glasses - and this was hundreds of years ago. Michaelangelo was an artistic genius.</p>

<p>Like every other city where tourism is rife, there are elements that detriment it, but it''s easy to look past the tourist shops, the annoying men who try to make you pay for photographs and take their flowers and see Rome for the amazing place it is.</p>

<p><span class="first">I</span> realised the other day just how few blogs I post about music.</p>
<p><b>This is because modern music is shit.</b></p>

<p>Now, I''m not trying to be some anti-mainstream hipster or anything, but it''s true - the vast majority of music that gets any kind of airplay these days is bloody awful; it''s all some kind of clubbed-up generic auto-tuned tat. Most of it is derived from rap music, which is horrific enough in itself, but even people who enjoy hip-hop must be distraught at what has become to their once respected genre of music <i>(I mean, does Dappy really strike fear into the heart of middle-class white parents as much as someone like 50 Cent?)</i>.</p>

<p>However, contrary to what I just said, there seems to be a shift of balance from this pop/rap/balls to light rock bands in the charts. It''s a new wave of Indie, but not quite so irritating. The Black Keys, for example, after 9 years of relative obscurity in the UK, hit it big with their release of El Camino and in particular the single Lonely Boy at the end of last year, and other alternative artists such as Gotye and Band of Skulls have brought some semblance of decent music back to life.</p>

<p>Let''s focus on Band of Skulls and their new album <i>Sweet Sour</i>.</p>

<p>The lead single "The Devil Takes Care of His Own" clearly takes a lot of inspiration from the early days of grunge and combining it with some good, old-fashioned rock. It''s got a great, pounding chorus with brilliant work on the drums by Matt Hayward. This is mirrored in the album''s titular track, and it makes for some good, easy listening.</p>

<p>Not all of the tracks are as heavy, though, and these songs vary in quality. "Wanderluster" is a brilliant mid-tempo piece, but it''s followed by the average, repetitive and slightly boring "Navigate". "Bruises" and "Lay My Head Down" also exhibit the same problems, but not as badly as "Hometowns", which is, by far, the lowest point on the album.</p>

<p>One of the album''s highlights is "You Ain''t Pretty, But You Got It Going On" which returns to the more uptempo beat of the band''s better songs, and displays the band''s songwriting ability - which prevails over technical playing - with a pretty good breakdown/solo about halfway through.</p>

<p>All in all, it''s a 50-50 split between good, rocky songs and slow, boring songs. Sweet Sour is a very apt name indeed. It''s not perfect, but it''s a step in the right direction from the Southampton outfit, and when it''s good, it''s <i>very</i> good.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Music', N'Sweet Sour aptly sums up the quality of Band of Skull''s latest release.', N'sweet sour, band of skulls, devil takes care of his own, rock, music, reviews, mainstream music, modern music sucks, you ain''t pretty but you got it going on, scummers', '20120301 16:23:23', '20131121 16:23:23', 0, 0)

<p>To be honest, I''d say at this point the series that I love so much has hit an all-time low. Roger Moore should have stopped three films ago, and yet Broccoli keeps on bashing out film after average film with ol'' Rodge in the vain hope that he becomes a suitable 007. Thankfully though, this is the last time we see him (and we don''t even see him that much).</p>
<p>The 1980s is now well and truly underway in all its tacky glory and the world is obsessed with computers and microchips. As usual, Bond is up to date on all of the latest trends and is even credited with inventing one - snowboarding took off in a big, big way after Moore''s stunt double took to the slopes in A View To A Kill.</p>
<h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3>
<p>Duran Duran! Christopher Walken! Grace Jones! Computers! 1980s culture! This should be the best Bond yet! Of course, though, it isn''t, because Roger Moore''s in it. A View To A Kill is mostly another eyebrow-waggling averageathon, but it doesn''t matter, because next time we have DALTON.</p>
<h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3>
<p>Both May Day and Zorin are fantastic villains, and although many critics deemed Walken''s assassination of his minions with a machine gun unnecessary as the film was already dark enough, I think it showed just how batshit insane he is. Moore said ''It wasn''t what Bond is all about'' but he just thinks Bond is about shagging women 35 years too young for him so let''s ignore his opinion.</p>
<p>In fact, the only person in the film more dangerously insane than Zorin is Grace Jones, who is absolutely terrifying at the best of times but even more so when you give her a mental character to play. Even her final moments as she turns heroic are laced with utter psychosis.</p>
<p>The only slight flaw with Zorin''s character is that apparently he can speak 6 languages without an accent when Walken can''t speak fucking English without an accent.</p>
<b><h3>And the worst bit?</h3></b>
<p>The stunts are amazing, and some of the best seen in the series, but they''d be a hell of a lot better if you could actually believe it was 007 doing them. There''s not even an attempt to hide the fact that Moore is far too old to perform anything so physically taxing, and it almost seems that they are deliberately pointing out that he''s not in the film that much.</p>
<p>There''s also the least subtle innuendo banter, ever -</p>
<p><i>Bond - ''So I take it you''ve spent a lot of time in the saddle?''<br>
Slag - ''Yes, I love an early morning ride.''<br>
Bond (with one eyebrow raised) - ''Oh, I''m an early riser myself.''</i></p>
<p>I mean, come on, put some effort in. Speaking of which, the scene in which they say the film''s title - nonsensical enough as it is - well, makes no sense.</p>
<p><i>May Day - ''What a view.''<br>
Max Zorin - ''To a Kill...''</i></p>
<p>....what?</p>
<p>One final point to bemoan, Tanya Roberts'' performance as Stacey Sutton only detriments the film further, as her character cannot decide if she''s a smoking hot, brilliantly intelligent heiress to a ridiculously profitable company or a stupid annoying bitch who simply screams the whole time, and that lovely arse of hers suddenly isn''t a good enough motivation to struggle through watching her performance. Although for 120 minutes of the film, Roger Moore FINALLY realised that these girls are too young for him. WELL DONE YOU, RODGE. (Of course he''s in the shower necking with her in the closing sequence).</p>
<h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3>
<p>Duran Duran are undeniably awesome. God knows what the lyrics mean but the song is awesome and that tacky neon title sequence that backs it is beyond cool. THE 80s WAS SO EPIC. John Barry, as per yoosh, does excellently adapting this into a proper soundtrack and not a disco.</p>
<hr>
<p>So we''re finally rid of Roger Moore. Hooray! Now we get Timmy D! HOORAY! </p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p><span class="first">F</span>alse hope occasionally gets the best of us all, and although Skyward Sword is a fantastic game which utilises the motion controls of the Wii to perfection, it''s flawed. Massively.</p>

<p>The town of Skyloft is amazing, and there''s secrets in every nook and cranny and every character is brilliantly realised and given their own story and quest. It''s in this hub that the most fun of the game takes place, and there''s enough sidequests to keep you going for hours. Outside of this, though, the world is disappointingly small. The three main hubs are pretty linear and don''t have that many places to explore and there''s no other towns in the game at all. If there were other places - just a couple more - like Skyloft, the game would be infinitely better.</p>

<p>In fact, in a lot of ways, where Twilight Princess was OOT''s spiritual successor, Skyward Sword follows the pattern of Majora''s Mask. The fantastic hub surrounded by smaller areas (Clock Town in MM, Skyloft in SS) and the shift of storyline from Ganondorf to something a little more supernatural (a mask in MM, an evil demon sword in SS). It''s not quite as obvious as OOT to TP, but the elements are there.</p>

<p>The items, too, are slightly disappointing. They lack invention - aside from the Beetle I think all of them are from previous games. And the Beetle''s shit until you upgrade it.</p>

<p>Which leads me along nicely to one of the game''s better points - the upgrade system. It''s a brilliant, if small, addition, that makes you really want to go get the treasure and bugs that are scattered around the world - it would be good if they applied this to your sword too, but this gets upgraded through the storyline.</p>

<p>And that leads me on to my final point - the story. The characterisation is second to no game I''ve ever played, which is extremely impressive, considering that all the dialogue is text-based. The story starts off brilliantly and continues well through the middle, but as it reaches the end, it feels padded out to include the final three dungeons (all of which are very good, by the way) without any real reason. OOT at least attempted to make excuses for the dungeon - there''s a monster coming out of the well, the Gorons have been kidnapped, Saria done fucked up, etc. But Skyward Sword just keeps saying ''the Goddess is testing you, Link''. In fact, a good 75% of the game is Link trying to prove to the Goddess that he''s not a bad guy. If I was Link, I''d have walked straight back home and got a different princess.</p>

Whilst 90% of browsing is still done on a traditional desktop, the amount of browsing that takes place on Mobile Phones and Tablets has almost doubled in the last year.</p>
<p>The flipside of this is that a large proportion of websites aren''t very easy to use on the interfaces that these devices provide.  Hover menus need to be re-designed, and the whole layout of the site often needs to be entirely re-done from scratch. So what options do you have when you try to make your website mobile compatible, and which one should you choose? Here''s some tips.</p>
<h3>Do you need a seperate domain?</h3>
<p>Ever noticed on a mobile browser, you''re often directed to a different URL (normally m.domain or mob.domain)? Well, whether you need this depends entirely on how much you are changing your website, and its scale and size. If your website is only a small blog or portfolio site with not that much data to load, then it''s not entirely necessary. However, if you want to change the content of the site itself, it''s probably best to host the site on its own subdomain, whilst still connecting to the same database.</p>
<p>For example with the <a href="http://m.gap360.com">Gap 360</a> mobile site, there was a lot of information that we wanted to strip out to reduce loading times (keep in mind that 3G connections are a lot, lot slower than Wi-Fi) and so we felt that it was necessary to give it it''s own subdomain.</p>
<p>This isn''t always necessary though - if you just want a quick fix then add the CSS property display:none to the elements you want to hide in your @media Queries. Speaking of which...</p>
<h3>CSS @media Queries</h3>
<p>Horizontal scrolling is one of the absolute no-nos of web design - and this is no exception on mobile. CSS @media Queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to detect certain elemets of a user''s browser or device and adjust the style accordingly. For mobile sites, the main issue we have is screen width.</p>
<p>You can use @media Queries in addition to your standard CSS so that if you don''t want to set up a seperate website for your mobile site, you don''t have to. The main queries to use on mobile are:
</p><div style="padding:10px;background-color:#dedede;font-family:''courier new'', monospace;font-size:12px;color:black;">
/*Mobile: Portrait*/<br>
@media only screen and (max-width: 479px){}
<br><br>
/*Mobile: Landscape*/<br>
@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width:767px){}
<br><br>
/*Tablets: Portrait*/<br>
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {}
</div>
<p>For landscape tablets, @media Queries aren''t necessary as they will be the same width as most browser windows.</p>
<p>Although obviously you can go back and forth and check your site on your mobile device (which you should, and make sure you do before launching it, as mobile devices render differently) a quick way of testing @media Queries is to resize the width of your browser window, and your CSS will automatically be applied.</p><h3>Remember to Redirect!</h3>
<p>If someone visits your website on their mobile device, and your mobile site is on a different domain, you want them to immediately be re-directed to your mobile site. The best way of doing this is using Javascript to detect your device. The following code will do exactly that for practically all mobile devices, simply replace the green text with the code you want to run if your site is visited on a mobile device and then paste it into your &lt;head&gt;:</p>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#dedede;font-family:''courier new'', monospace;font-size:12px;color:black;">
var redirectagent = navigator.userAgent. toLowerCase(); <br>
var redirect_devices = [''vnd.wap.xhtml+xml'', ''sony'', ''symbian'', ''nokia'', ''samsung'', ''mobile'', ''windows ce'', ''epoc'', ''opera mini'', ''nitro'', ''j2me'', ''midp-'', ''cldc-'', ''netfront'', ''mot'', ''up.browser'', ''up.link'', ''audiovox'', ''blackberry'', ''ericsson'', ''panasonic'', ''philips'', ''sanyo'', ''sharp'', ''sie-'', ''portalmmm'', ''blazer'', ''avantgo'', ''danger'', ''palm'', ''series60'', ''palmsource'', ''pocketpc'', ''smartphone'', ''rover'', ''ipaq'', ''au-mic'', ''alcatel'', ''ericy'', ''vodafone'', ''wap1'', ''wap2'', ''teleca'', ''playstation'', ''lge'', ''lg-'', ''iphone'', ''android'', ''htc'', ''dream'', ''webos'', ''bolt'', ''nintendo''];<br>
for (var i in redirect_devices) {<br>
if (redirectagent.indexOf (redirect_devices[i]) != -1) {<br><br>
<span style="color:green">Action if a mobile device</span><br><br>
}
}
</div>
<p>So what if you want to re-direct them straight to the mobile version of the page you were trying to access? Well, this is a simple piece of JavaScript to do exactly that. It gets the first 10 characters of the URL, and replaces them with the mobile subdomain''s URL. Replace the green text with the first three letters of your website''s name (for people who navigate to your site not using ''www'') and this code will redirect mobile users to m.yoursite.com!</p>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#dedede;font-family:''courier new'', monospace;font-size:12px;color:black;">var reDir=document.URL;

var reDirSub = reDir.substring(0, 10);<br>
if (reDirSub === "http://www") {reDir = reDir.replace("http://www", "http://m");}<br>
else if (reDirSub === "http://<span style="color:green">dec</span>"){ reDir = reDir.replace ("http://","http://m."); }<br>
location.replace(reDir);
</div>

<p>There are, of course, many ways of creating a mobile site, but I feel that the methods I have outlined above provide a solid starting point, at least.</p>

Yes, that''s right - Adams is (as far as I know) the only actress to play two different Bond girls in the series.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Ignoring this massive continuity error (by this point we''ve had 3 Bonds and 2 actors to play M, and countless playing Felix Leiter, so I think we can safely say continuity isn''t the series'' strong point) it''s not too bad. I mean, it''s nothing spectacular, just a run-of-the-mill Bond film, but since when was that a bad thing?</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Steven Berkoff as the psychopathic Russian General Orlov is beyond brilliant. His performance is one of the best in the series and he has a hilarious yet frightening character to back it up.</p><p>The scenes in Delhi are very good indeed. I''ve never been to India, but if I do, I hope it''s as crazy as it is in Octopussy. Every part from the crazy motorised rickshaw race to Q''s secret base is great fun and massively entertaining - just the way Bond should be.</p><p>The jungle chase scene - Tarzan yell aside - is frantic and brilliant as 007 has to escape Kamal Khan''s hunting tour in addition to all the majestic dangerous wildlife he encounters.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>The ''comic relief'' is fuckwittedly dire, and it doesn''t fit in to a film that has a somewhat darker tone than most others in the series. But the fact remains that even if the film was as silly as Moonraker or The Man With The Golden Gun, there is no place in James Bond for 007 to be dressing up as a gorilla or a clown. Or do a Tarzan yell.</p><p>And where would we be without some unfounded racism - upon handing his Indian sidekick a wad of cash, he says ''That should keep you in curries''. It''s not even very inventive.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Rita Coolidge sings ''All Time High'', which isn''t really to my taste at all. It''s slow and boring. However John Barry returns to the soundtrack and as a whole it''s better than For Your Eyes Only.</p><hr><p>As Ol'' Rodge slows from a canter to a trot, we approach the end of his tenure. Next month, after what seems like a lifetime, is the last time we will see Moore don the tuxedo. Thank Christ.</p>

<p><span class="first">T</span>his time last year I was writing this blog in my spare time between animating a geek, a fatty, a slut and a robot. Oh, and an emo kid, but no-one really cares about him. How times have changed that I am now writing this in my lunch hour of a serious office job. I may have grown up a little bit, but on the inside I''m still the same old Dec, bringing you the same Delicious and Excellent Concepts, this time for 2011.</p><hr>
</div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/elcamino.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><h3><b>AWARD ONE: ALBUM OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>To be perfectly honest, I don''t listen to that much new music anymore - I find myself preoccupied playing games, watching movies or football, doing work or something else. When I do listen to music it''s often 80''s classics. But there have been a few new releases this year which I''ve thoroughly enjoyed. There was, of course, the debut album from&nbsp;<a href="http://declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=51&amp;catid=4">Nero</a>&nbsp;which I reviewed earlier this year. Another contender was Machine Head''s&nbsp;<i>Unto The Locust</i>&nbsp;which was the best metal album I''ve heard in years. And let''s not forget about the spectacular release from Dream Theater,&nbsp;<i>A Dramatic Turn of Events</i>, with prog-rock tracks such as the fantastic&nbsp;<i>On The Backs of Angels</i>. It''s pipped to the post by an absolutely phenomenal album -&nbsp;<b>El Camino by The Black Keys</b>. I love the bluesey-rock fusion and the whole album is brilliantly catchy - one of my desert island discs, I think.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><h3><b>AWARD TWO: GAME OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>You get the picture. In fact, there have been so many fantastic games that I simply haven''t had the chance to play all of them - those listed are simply a handful of amazing titles that I''ve had the privilege to play. So, onto the winner - it''s going to be Skyward Sword, isn''t it?&nbsp;<b>WRONG.</b>&nbsp;I love Skyward Sword but it''s lacking... something. And that something is a sizeable game world to explore. A principle point of the Zelda series, you are normally rewarded for getting involved and finding out secrets all over the map - but Skyward Sword''s is not like that. Am I disappointed? A little. It''s still better than most of those games I listed off earlier, but it''s not my favourite game of the year.</p><p>Another worthy mention is LA Noire. It''s a landmark in innovation and in the gaming industry, a merger of genres that I hope many developers follow. It''s representative of originality in a age full of clones and sequels (good as some of those may be) and Rockstar really pushed the boat out. It''s difficult to deny that they could have done so much more with the game, but it''s&nbsp;<i>impossible</i>&nbsp;to deny that what they did acheive was truly remarkable.</p><p>But the crème de la crème, the superlative, the ultimate victor this year, was&nbsp;<b>Uncharted 3: Drake''s Deception</b>. An absolutely stunning piece of software, one that perfectly combines platforming, shooting and puzzle-based gameplay into a magnificently cinematic spectacle, an interactive movie that allows you to really get involved. Aside from being a little linear, it''s the best game I''ve played in a long time that truly sucks you into the story and simply entertains. A masterpiece.<br></p><p></p>
</div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-11-21/drake.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr><h3><b>AWARD THREE: FILM OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>Of course, though, this isn''t necessarily a bad thing. Sequels tend to exist because of both a critically and commercially successful first film. Oftentimes, they don''t live up to the original, but in the case of&nbsp;<i>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</i>, it kept the interesting formula of the original and the banter between Holmes, Watson and Moriarty was top-notch. Robert Downey Jr excelled again and the whole film was an easy watch, as Ritchie continues to blend his distinct style into the beloved Conan-Doyle character.</p><p>Of course, not every film was a sequel -&nbsp;<i>Black Swan</i>&nbsp;was, although not to my taste, an excellent example of sublime film-making, with by far and away the best cinematography of the year. I struggled to connect with the storyline personally but it didn''t stop me appreciating what was an extremely good film.</p><p>But the best film of the year wasn''t because of its brilliant visual effects, or its distinct style. It was simply laugh-out-loud funny, relateable and 100% English.&nbsp;<b>The Inbetweeners Movie</b>&nbsp;quite deservedly takes this award, as it builds and improves on every aspect of the superb television series. It''s crude, rude - often unnecessarily so - but the stereotypes are so real, you''ll see yourself and your friends everywhere you look. It remained on at the cinema in the UK for several months, grossing an eventual £45million from a £3.5 million budget - a success if ever I saw one. If you haven''t seen it, do. It''s beyond brilliant.</p><p></p>

But there''s the second series of&nbsp;<i>Game of Thrones</i>&nbsp;to look forward to, many, many games including&nbsp;<i>Borderlands 2</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i>, and the launch of the first next-gen console, the Wii U - which looks very good, especially now they''ve realised that only having one controller per console was an unbelievably stupid idea. I''m especially looking forward to the connectivity between this and the upcoming 3DS&nbsp;<i>Super Smash Bros</i>, which will undoubtedly be amazing.</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>The thing I''m looking forward to most, though, is the final instalment to Christopher Nolan''s Batman Trilogy,&nbsp;<b>The Dark Knight Rises</b>. The name''s a little bit stupid but if it''s even a fraction as good as&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight</i>&nbsp;was it''ll be the best film of the decade already. Aside from a title that doesn''t really roll off the tongue and *shudder* Anne Hathaway in it, there''s nothing that puts me off - I can''t wait to see Tom Hardy as Bane, and the return of some of my favourite actors (Bale, Freeman, and Oldman). Should be an absolute cracker.<br></p><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p></p><h3><b>AWARD FIVE: BEST&nbsp;<strike>DOWNLOADABLE</strike>&nbsp;PORTABLE GAME OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>I''m going to make these awards interchangeable as I honestly haven''t downloaded many games this year - but I have bought several portable ones. The rules for this award are slightly less strict than the downloadable ones, in that they can be available on other formats, as oftentimes the portable version of a game is totally different. And with the introduction of the 3DS and soon to be the PS Vita, there''s going to be a lot of good ones this coming year.</p><p></p><p>However, it would be silly not to mention the 3DS, which was released this year - to a slow start - but picked up as it drew nearer to Christmas. Honourable mentions for this include&nbsp;<i>Starfox 3D</i>,&nbsp;<i>Super Mario 3D Land</i>, and of course, the timeless&nbsp;<i>Ocarina of Time</i>&nbsp;remake. As much as I''d love to give the award to OOT, I don''t think that''s fair - I''ll give it to a new game rather than a straightforward remake.<br></p><p>The winner isn''t a 3DS game, though - in fact, it''s not even one game. Yup, you guessed it -&nbsp;<b>Pokémon Black and White</b>&nbsp;both take the award graciously, as the classic RPG series continues to develop its winning structure even further. The sort of mini-reboot was a good experience to see totally new Pokémon without the old ones, and it adds a few little extras to the structure just to make them both incredibly well-rounded games.<br></p>

It truly is a masterclass in filmography though, and makes me desperate to visit these spectacular icy wastelands. Another fantastic travel show - although vastly different - is the second series of&nbsp;<i>An Idiot Abroad</i>, which, although it seems to be a bit more scripted than the first, is hilarious from start to finish, and I find myself feeling more and more in tune with Karl Pilkington, as he says what many people must be thinking.</p><p>But the winner, of course, there could be no other -&nbsp;<b>Game of Thrones</b>&nbsp;was simply astonishing and probably better than any film I''ve seen this year. I cannot wait for the second series and hope that it lives up to the amazing show that was the first series.</p><p></p>

<p><i>This is a blog I wrote for <a href="http://www.thepoliticalanimal.co.uk/">The Political Animal</a> - please check out their other interesting articles!</i></p>

<p><span class="first">T</span>here are certain people in this world that really grind my gears. National Rail, designer retail assistants (who are you to look down on me, you’re not rich, you work in a shop) and protestors.</p>
<p>I realise that it’s a very broad thing to say, but time and time again, our society is becoming increasingly disrupted by “peaceful” protests. This in itself is a bit of an oxymoron, because if a protest was truly peaceful, no-one would stand up and listen to the points that are being made – the entire point of a protest is to make people evaluate their points of view by interrupting their way of life. They’re normally non-violent, yes – but non-violence and peacefulness are not mutually exclusive. They also provide cover for those who simply want to cause trouble, and, more often than is desirable, things get out of hand.</p>
<p>The main brunt of my anger is focused towards those who recently took it upon themselves to occupy St. Paul’s Cathedral. Not only is this a massive inconvenience for anyone that needs to go through there, but the focus of their protest is simply absurd. “The system doesn’t work”. “Down with capitalism”. “All of the money goes to the top 1%”. “Finding a job is difficult”. These seem to be the key points they raise here, so let me deal with them individually.</p>
<p>The system DOES work. Is it perfect? Of course not, but no system would be. It’s a problem that is organic when a population and society grows and develops to such an extent that there are sixty million people in the country – not all of them are good people, and it’s pretty difficult for any body of government to keep control when many are greedy, immoral or simply lazy. Taking into account all 60 million people’s personalities and benefiting every single one is not only difficult, it’s simply impossible.</p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66"><p>Additionally, capitalism is the reason they can purchase their iPhones, wear their Nike trainers and eat McDonalds whilst using Twitter to document the “fascist overlords” throwing out the “#ows” protestors (Occupy Wall Street, a similar movement happening in New York) – even though many of them are out of work. So how they can suggest that capitalism – for all its flaws – should be removed in our country is hypocritical and downright stupid.</p><p>And yes, they’re absolutely right, the money does go to the top 1%. Because the “1%” bloody work for it. Yes, they could probably sort out the UK’s recession in a heartbeat. Yes, they’re greedy, dislikeable and not very nice people, but at least they have a job, and aren’t interfering with the general public’s lives by sitting in front of a cathedral with some signs. And in the end – they earned the money. Whatever they do with it is their choice, and not the governments, so what exactly are you trying to achieve? To change the minds of the richest and most powerful men in the country by hiding in some tents?</p><p></p>
</div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/featured-images/protest-against-a-protest.jpg"></div></div><div class="col col-33 html-col movable resizable edit-col" style=""><p><i>Sadly, I don''t think this is a joke.</i></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>As for jobhunting, I was on Jobseeker’s for 2 months and it was the most depressing period of my life, but I spent literally every second of the day trying to get a job, any job, and my hard work paid off. I got several interviews and eventually a job offer, where I work hard to pay my taxes and repay the debt I incurred at University, and doing my part to get the economy back on track. Yes, finding a job is hard. It’s a lot harder when you’re not looking.</p><p>During my time down at the Job centre, I saw some very strange sights – including a man drinking away his benefits, and when asked to leave, pouring the rest of it down his trousers. I overheard another delinquent purchasing oral services from someone right outside the front door with a five pound note, presumably immediately after signing on. The problem lies more with these people than with the “1%”.</p><p>Another enraging fact – an infrared scan of the tents showed that only 20% of them had anyone in it. Meaning that rather than actually do a proper protest, many of these people still go home. I lose even more respect for them knowing that they won’t go whole hog.</p><p>Oh, and to top it all off, these people are not the “99%”. They are the “20%” that have a degree. They are more likely to find a job than the other 79%, and yet they spend their time doing nothing, much as the tramp and whoremonger outside the Job centre do.</p><p>Everybody wants something for nothing.</p><p></p>

It''s only a brief moment of decent storytelling though before Blofeld - absent for four films prior to this - suddenly comes back with the ability to control a helicopter remotely. Thankfully, Bond drops him down a chimney before they can mess up his character any more.</p><p>One of the most genuinely funny moments of the series hapens in this film, when a group of henchmen attempting to chase Bond try to smash his beautiful Lotus in, taking no notice of the ''Burglary Protected'' sign in the window. The car''s protection system is in fact an explosion.</p><p>I also like Columbo as a sidekick. He''s charismatic, funny and has a silly accent.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>I''d like to take a minute here to salute the performance of Bernard Lee in all of the Bond films up until this point, for his authoritative and no-nonsense displayal as the head of MI6. His performances, along with Desmond Llewellyn and Lois Maxwell''s, painted a brilliant picture of how the British Secret Service worked, and his untimely death was a severe knock to this film as they drafted in James Villiers as the cheif of staff to replace him.</p><p>With the excuse for M''s absence being ''on leave'' (I''m thankful they mentioned that he wasn''t involved) Bond''s briefing scenes are now given by an irritating fool and the Minister for Defence. Whilst Geoffery Keen, as normal, does a good job as the Minister (a similar character to M in many ways), in that he''s bossy and mean and yet somehow not dislikeable, Villiers is just a twat. His stupid accent, his pathetic attitude - it''s all awful. Thank god this is only for one film.</p><p>And Margaret Thatcher shouldn''t have been in this film. At all. I''m not even going to describe how angry it makes me.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Many people rant and rave about how Blondie should have been given the theme tune, but I actually much prefer Sheena Easton''s romantic effort. Although I''m not really a fan of the whole ''I''m in the title sequence'' thing. I prefer the naked ladies dancing around on their own without a stereotypical 80''s singer in the background.</p><p>The rest of the soundtrack is done by Bill Conti, and whilst it''s not as good as John Barry''s efforts, it''s got a pretty good, upbeat, cheesy 80''s feel to it. Not bad.</p><hr>So now we''ve forgotten the name of that greek man, his friends and uh... someone else that appeared in For Your Eyes Only, let''s look forward to a woman with eight vaginas!<p></p>

People say that this was before George Lucas started ruining everything he touched, but he inadvertently messed up James Bond by convincing Cubby Broccoli that everyone liked space. And thus, Moonraker was filmed.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Moonraker is just silly. From start to finish, it is silly. Actually, scratch that. It''s fucking stupid. The very beginning where Jaws - who in The Spy Who Loved Me was an intimidating, frightening assassin - is seen to be flapping like a bird when his parachute inexplicably fails to open sets the tone for the retardation that will follow.</p><p>And then there''s the whole space station bollocks. I understand that all of the James Bond films are a little fantastical but people flying around in space firing lasers at eachother just takes the piss.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Hugo Drax, the film''s antagonist is a lot more convincing than Karl Stromberg was in The Spy Who Loved Me - a villain with essentially the same idea, just in space aside from underwater. The pressure simulator scene is very tense and Moore''s performance in this scene is actually quite good - unlike the rest of his acting in Moonraker.</p><p>Other than that, er... it''s not as boring as Thunderball.</p><p></p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Where to start?</p><p>Well the fact that his camera has 007 on it is extremely stupid and unnecessary.

<p><span class="first">T</span>he Legend Of Zelda is, in my opinion, the greatest series of videogames ever to grace this world. I am so hyped for Skyward Sword it is unreal. In this special I will give a brief overview of each game in the main series.</p>


<p></p><h3>THE LEGEND OF ZELDA (1986, NES)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>The game that more or less invented the action adventure genre. Almost every mechanic used in modern day AA gaming originated here. The sprawling overworld littered with baddies and secret caves, the dungeon-based system, the puzzles and obstacles that require you to use specific items before you can overcome them - here. Granted, storyline wise it''s a bit flat, and its successors improve vastly on the mechanics introduced here so going back to it makes it seem a little dated, but it is 25 years old. If you cut it a little slack, you''ll find that it''s still an immersive and incredibly enjoyable adventure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK (1987, NES)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only game in the entire series that I would call weak. This is because it departs radically from the standards set by its predecessor and adopts a side-scrolling view that makes the world feel flatter (no pun intended) and limited the game mechanics too.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn''t the only reason that the game wasn''t as successful. I mean, around the same time, the Metroid games were proving that the side-on view could produce brilliant worlds, fantastic puzzles and superb action to boot. For some reason, Zelda II just failed to capture the world''d imagination in the same way as the first.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>A LINK TO THE PAST (1991, SNES)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, Nintendo realised that their experiment hadn''t quite worked and reverted to the style of the original Zelda, but suddenly the world was bigger, more vibrant, full of NPCs and the story a lot more driven and detailed.</p>

<p>ALTTP was the first game in the series to implement the ''Dual World'' gameplay, which would become a major factor in several of the later games. Perhaps the best part was when you got to what you thought was the last dungeon, only to realise that you weren''t even halfway through. The Dark World may have been a mirror of the Light World, but the differences were significant enough for you to carry on playing to the very end without getting bored once.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>LINK''S AWAKENING (1993, Game Boy)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal favourite of the 2D Zelda Games, Link''s Awakening follows directly from A Link To The Past as Link sets off for an adventure across the seas. On his voyage he gets shipwrecked and washes up on a mysterious island, although the storyline strongly implies that the whole thing is merely a figment of his imagination. Link''s Awaening is the first of many Zelda games to use music as one of its main themes, and it''s pretty awesome in every way.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>OCARINA OF TIME (1998, Nintendo 64)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a five year gap between Link''s Awakening and the next game, but the next one would be the definitive game in the series. Ocarina of Time was the first 3D Zelda game, and it made the transition perfectly. It took into account everything that had been successful about the previous four outings - the music, the dual world, the characters and dungeons and storyline themes - set the story before all of the others, and introduced a huge amount of features that would change not only the series, but gaming in general, forever.</p>

<p>The main feature it introduced was left-trigger targeting, which is now used in almost every genre you can think of in some way. The open world was unlike any other seen before, with seemingly boundless limits to the exploration and a million secrets buried everywhere. It remains, to this day, the most immersive game I''ve ever played - and I think immersion is the most important part of gaming, a pastime based almost entirely of escapism of real life. Upon release, it was, frankly, perfection.</p>

<p>It has been surpassed in a million ways by then - both by its successors and other games - but that doesn''t stop OOT from having a kind of timeless nostalgia and charm that will never go away. It set a new bar for video games, and many still struggle to hit it. If you''ve never played a Zelda game, this is where to start. Get the updated 3DS version and you''ll never regret it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>MAJORA''S MASK (2000, Nintendo 64)</h3><p></p>
<p>

</p><p>Another staggeringly brilliant entry to the series (the N64 really did have some of the best software ever), MM basically built and improved upon the already fantastic OOT engine and made the storyline a hell of a lot darker. This is by far the darkest in the Zelda series, as the moon is about to crash into the planet and destroy it, and that moon has a SERIOUSLY creepy face.</p>

<p>The gameplay is brilliant, with the three day time limit allowing for some amazing time-based side quests - the most epic of all being reuniting Anju and Kafei an hour before the world ends - and gives the game a fresh dynamic that I haven''t seen used in many other places. And then of course, the masks system is a lot of fun too.</p>

<p>Many people prefer MM to OOT and it''s easy to see why - but again I go back to the immersion point. I feel very aware that I''m playing a game while I''m playing Majora, but with Ocarina, I feel more like I''m on an adventure. But don''t let it discourage you, because Majora''s Mask is amazing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>ORACLE OF SEASONS/AGES (2001, Game Boy)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>By this point it''s been eight years since the last 2D Zelda game (not counting the director''s cut re-release of Link''s Awakening), and so, cashing in on the Pokémon ''you-must-own-both-versions-to-complete-the-game-properly'' phenomenon, Nintendo released the Oracle games. Unlike the Pokémon versions though, they are two completely different adventures. Gameplay wise, it''s basically LA but with dual-world gameplay (quad-world in the case of seasons). Personally, I prefer Seasons, because there''s a lot more variation in the puzzles, but they''re both fantastic additions to the series. The ''linked ending'' seems a little pointless, as the games aren''t really that related, but it''s definitely worth playing both, so why not do the linkage as well?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>THE WIND WAKER (2002, Gamecube)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Wind Waker caused such a massive uproar amongst the gaming community and Zelda fans alike due to its controversial use of cel-shaded graphics. In a time when ''realism'' in gaming was hitting a peak, this style was a dangerous decision by Nintendo, but upon release, all controversy was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>The only word I can really think to describe Wind Waker is ''timeless''. The graphical style is timeless - if you replicated the graphics on a higher-powered console, you couldn''t make them any better. The gameplay is timeless - as you sail across the Great Sea, listening to the fully orchestrated music (also timeless) you have a truly epic sense of adventure, and the sword fighting is improved, built upon and expanded from previous instalments. The storyline''s great, too, as it''s diverted (a bit) from the whole ''you need three gems for no real reason'' aspect of other Zelda games.</p>

<p>The only problem I have with Wind Waker is that while it''s huge - which is fantastic - is that maybe it''s a little too huge. It could do with being a teeny bit smaller, as the sailing, while fun at first, does get a little tedious when you have to sail from one side of the map to the other and there''s no convenient warp spots.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>THE MINISH CAP (2004, Game Boy Advance)</h3><p></p>
<p>

</p><p>A last rendition for the 2D Zelda games, The Minish Cap is essentially Link''s Awakening with a new story, world, items and cleaner, crisper presentation. All of this makes for another great adventure, revolving around the titular item the Minish Cap, which allows Link to shrink and enlarge as he pleases. Another worthy addition the series, if not terribly innovative.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>TWILIGHT PRINCESS (2006, Gamecube/Wii)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>I''ll be focusing on the Wii version for this, as it''s the version I''ve played. After the ''kid-friendly'' Wind Waker, many fans demanded a new, more realistic Zelda game, more similar to Ocarina of Time, and, well, that''s exactly what they got.</p>

<p>Twilight Princess is OOT''s spiritual successor in every single way. The detailed graphics were some of the best seen on the Gamecube/PS2/Xbox generation, and the game world was essentially Hyrule from OOT, but bigger. The dungeons include some of the best level design I''ve ever seen, and Link can turn into a wolf, which is not only cool but plays pretty well too. It utilises the Wii motion controls, in my opinion, perfectly, so it''s great fun without being so gimmicky that it ruins it.</p>

<p>However, despite all this, there''s something a little bit lacklustre about Twilight Princess. It''s amazing, yes, but it''s trying too hard to be Ocarina of Time, when the simple fact is that it''s not. The ending''s also a little disappointing, as they seem to shove Ganon in there for the sake of it, when he''s not even relevant to the storyline. But it says a lot about the series that a game THIS amazing can be qualified as a let-down compared to the other games.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p><h3>PHANTOM HOURGLASS (2007, Nintendo DS)</h3><p></p>
<p>

</p><p>The two-dimensional era is well and truly dead as portable consoles embrace 3D, or at the very least, 2.5D. Phantom Hourglass is the first Zelda game to use this, as a sequel to The Wind Waker. Hyrule is still covered in water and so the sailing mechanic is still there but the capabilities of the DS allow you to draw your routes, adding an extra dimension to it. However it''s still the same - too much sailing with an occasional enemy attacking you that''s frankly just a little annoying.</p>

<p>The DS outings also include a new control scheme where you move Link around by the stylus, which is alright, but I do prefer using a D-pad (although admittedly this gives more control than the D-pad). The combat system is used by flicking the stylus across the screen, and to do a spin attack you draw a circle around Link, which is quite fun. You also get to do things like use the microphone and touch screen for certain items which make the game have a few more clever puzzles and more fun to play.</p>

<p>Overall I''m not as much of a fan of the 2.5D as the 2D, but it''d be stupid to dismiss them, as they''re still great games in their own right.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>SPIRIT TRACKS (2009, Nintendo DS)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Spirit Tracks is set about fifty years after Phantom Hourglass (you can tell by the age of some minor characters), and yet suddenly the world isn''t flooded anymore, there''s a million different civilisations and apparently there''s been train tracks in place for several hundred years. Great continuity there, Nintendo.</p>

<p>All this aside, the Train mechanic is actually quite fun. It''s obviously very similar to the sailing but overall I prefer it. It allows for some pretty fun side-quests and doesn''t feel as dragged out. Aside from this, though, it''s pretty similar to Phantom Hourglass, with the same basic mechanics. My main complaint is that the last boss feels a bit more like a mini-game than a struggle to save the world, but other than that it''s a very solid game.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>SKYWARD SWORD (2011, Wii)</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><i><a href="/skyward-sword">''I''ve deliberately read very little about Skyward Sword aside from watching the main trailer, which is enough to get me extremely excited. I''ve pre-ordered it and can''t wait to play it. I don''t know why, but I have a feeling it will be the best in the series yet.''</a></i></p><p></p><h3>A LINK BETWEEN WORLDS (2013, 3DS)</h3><p></p><p><i><a href="/a-link-between-worlds">''When I reviewed Skyward Sword&nbsp;2&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago, it was a tale of disappointment.&nbsp;Not this time.''</a><span style="line-height: 1.45em;"></span></i></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><span class="first">T</span>he 3DS is an interesting one. The first thing I did when I bought mine was go out and buy two 15-year old games (<i>Ocarina of Time 3D</i> and <i>Starfox 3D</i>), but I loved them both - updated experiences of two of my favourite childhood games. However, of course, a brand new games console shouldn''t be relying on games from two generations ago to sell itself, which would probably explain the console''s poor sales.</p>

<p>Once I''d finished with these two games, I went out to buy some more, naturally, as my new portable companion is all that''s keeping me from going insane on my four-hour round commute every day. I was dismayed to discover that there was nothing worth buying. The console''s launch line-up was dire, and it''s keeping me on edge until <i>Super Mario 3D, Kid Icarus</i> and <i>Smash Bros 3D</i> come out eventually. Luckily for me I skipped out a generation of portable gaming, so had plenty of DS games to catch up on, so got <i>Spirit Tracks</i> and <i>Pokémon Black</i> instead.</p>

<p>So, the software''s not that great. What about the hardware? The most obvious place to start is the console''s selling feature: the 3D screen. It''s incredible, frankly, although it takes some getting used to. When you first start playing it your eyes will probably take a few goes to adjust, but after a couple of plays, the 3D becomes normal, and it starts to become strange to playing games in 2D. Kudos to Nintendo, the 3D screen is fantastic. The graphics in general are roughly on a par with the Wii, which is extremely impressive for a handheld. And perhaps most impressive of all is the camera, capable of taking three-dimensional photos and provide brilliantly fun Augmented Reality games that are built into the console. <i>Face Raiders</i>, where you take pictures of you and your friends and then look like an idiot as you essentially use your console as a gun to shoot their flying faces down, is a work of absolute genius.</p>

<p>I''m also a big fan of the <i>StreetPass</i> feature, which wirelessly connects with other 3DS consoles and transfers data. The only two uses for it that I have seen are the transfers of Mii''s, which you can use to create 3D puzzles and go on a mini-RPG adventure - both of which are surprisingly addictive - and in <i>PES 2011</i> to play an automatic match between your Master League teams, which sounds brilliant, but I haven''t had a go at it yet.</p>

<p>The 3DS has such massive potential it''s a shame to see it squandered by such a poor software start, but there are a few games on the horizon - let''s just hope it''s enough to keep the console going.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', N'The 3DS is an interesting one.

</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p>AMERICAN BEAUTY is a 1999 Drama film starring Kevin Spacey and Anette Bening, directed by Sam Mendes (who is tipped to direct the upcoming Bond film). It’s one of those films where not that much really happens, but it has both style and substance to keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end.<br></p><p>Lester Burnham (Spacey) is a man going through a mid-life crisis. His daughter despises him, his wife (Bening) is having an affair with a substantially more successful man and he has a new boss who fires people faster than blinking. His response? Smoke a whole lot of cannabis, accuse his boss of sexual assault and start work in a fast food restaurant, fantasise over an underage girl, and, ultimately, get shot in the head.<br></p>

<h3><b>Why did I watch it?</b></h3>

<p>No, that’s not a spoiler. One of the first lines of the film is “in less than a year, I’ll be dead”. From that introduction, I knew it would be a movie that I would watch again, and again, and again – I was already asking who, how, why? Something that has been used in the crime genre since the beginning of cinema, but not very often in a drama series. AMERICAN BEAUTY is daring, unique and clever.</p>

<p>Plus, Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are two absolute top quality actors, and two of my favourites.</p>

<p>And let’s not rule out that the soundtrack is top notch – a mixture of classic rock, 60s swing and a simple piano motif repeated in various tempos throughout the film that invariably adds a lot more emotion to the scene, including a strange tranquil happiness at Lester’s death.</p>

<b><h3>Trivia</h3></b>
<ul>
<li>The title of the film refers to a breed of roses that while pretty and appealing in appearance, is often prone to rot underneath at the roots and branches of the plant. Thus, the tagline “…look closer” tells the viewer that when they look beyond the “perfect suburban life” they will find something rancid at the root.</li>

<li>Terry Gilliam turned down the chance to direct the film.</li>

<li>Jake Gyllenhall auditioned for the role of Ricky Fitz, but was turned down.</li>

<li>For the pot-smoking scenes, the actors used honey-smoked tobacco.</li>

<li>At the 72nd Academy Awards, it won 5 awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography.</li>

<li>Thora Birch was only 16 at the time of the film’s release, and so had to get permission from her parents to expose her breasts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Should you watch it?</b></h3>

<p>Hell yes. If you can find another film that makes you feel genuinely sorry for a pot-smoking paedophile without once questioning your own moral judgement, then maybe you’ll be forgiven for not watching it, but it’s truly unlike any other film I’ve ever watched. This is ultimately down to Kevin Spacey’s incredibly likeable personality and Annette Bening’s brilliant performance as a total bitch.</p>

<p>If you’re a film buff, undoubtedly you’ve already seen it, but if you haven’t, then I’m sorry, but you’re not a film buff. The cheerleader and plastic bag scenes are two of the most famous sequences in recent cinema, important for any self-respecting cinema fan to know, and has been lampooned by many comedians and programmes. Many of the themes are similar to FIGHT CLUB – which is strange because it’s a radically different film, but both talk about the materialism of the world and the disillusioned opinion towards consumerism that plagued the late 1990s, a generation which I can relate to.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the television series DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, look no further – creator Marc Cherry has cited AMERICAN BEAUTY as the inspiration for the dark suburban drama series. But if you don’t like DHW, don’t worry – it’s a lot more subtle than its subordinate, and undeniably better made.</p>

<p>Mendes has said retrospectively that AMERICAN BEAUTY got more recognition than it probably deserved, but I disagree. It’s a truly brilliant film, and deserves every one of the awards it got.</p>

Typical of Bond, this massive political event is reflected in the film, and it provides 007''s main objective.</p><p>It was also released at the height of the craze Britain had for kung fu movies, and so, naturally, Bond must become a martial arts expert to rival Bruce Lee himself to get through the film unharmed.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>I remember when I was a kid, The Man With The Golden Gun was one of my favourite Bond films, but watching it back now, it''s a bit shit. The script is limp, characterization is poor and aside from Christopher Lee all of the performances are shocking.</p><p>I think that the reason I enjoyed it so much at 8 years old is because it''s so light-hearted and comedic. Every aspect of it is made light of, from the kung fu to the midget to Britt Ekland''s portrayal of Bond''s idiotic sidekick to the to the flying car to the antagonist''s third nipple. It''s exactly the sort of crap that kids lap up, but it''s a little too fantastic and silly to watch once you''re past the age of 11.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Scaramanga''s Golden Gun is actually one of my favourite gadgets in the series, and not just because it''s awesome in Goldeneye 64. I love the scene where he kills Hai Fat, and puts the weapon together right in front of him without him noticing. It''s a brilliant concept for a gun.</p><p>The stunt where Bond flips the car is simply fantastic. It was done in one take and luckily done first time or else it would have taken a consdierably larger chunk out of the budget. Sadly it''s ruined by that stupid sound effect that is played over the top.</p><p>Also, despite all their tackiness, the kung fu sections are pretty genuinely entertaining, and the slutty naked Chinese girl in the swimming pool also provides Moore''s best eyebrow raise when she tells him to ''Chu Mi''.</p><p>However the best part of The Man With The Golden Gun is that we never see Sheriff J.W Pepper ever again.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>There are several low points in The Man With The Golden Gun, but the worst has to be when Bond discovers Andrea Anders murdered, and the plastic/wax/whatever model is horrifically unrealistic, and Guy Hamilton (director) seems to want to make it really obvious how bad it is by showing it close up from every angle. Terrible.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Dreadful doesn''t even begin to describe this atrocity. I don''t know who Lulu is and I don''t care. What''s most annoying is that a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsoyhpBsPus">perfectly acceptable version</a>&nbsp;by Alice Cooper was completely shunned.

Since the original SNES instalment back in 1992, Bananas and Mushrooms dominated the track and refused to be toppled.</p>

<p>But one game came very close, and in my opinion, bettered the red plumber in almost every single way on the track.</p>

<p><i>Crash Bandicoot</i> was Sony and Naughty Dog''s answer to Nintendo''s many mascots, and it was a good one. Crash appealed to the same generation as Mario with its bright cartoony graphics, but at the same time targeted those slightly older with its (slightly) more violent, and combat(ish) based puzzles. Obviously taking a huge inspiration from <i>Taz the Tasmanian Devil</i>, Crash spins and jumps his way through various themed worlds in order to save his little sister. (Sound familiar?)</p>

<p>And of course, no platform icon would be complete without a spin-off karting  game. After the massive success of Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3, <i>Crash Team Racing</i> was released in 1999, to solid acclaim, and for good reason. It''s actually a lot deeper than Mario Kart, with all the standard genre elements in there, but it takes it a little bit further.</p>

<p>The most notable additions are the upgradable weapons. You pick up Wompa fruit from around the track, and each piece makes you go faster, and when you hit ten, whichever item you are holding gets upgraded to a better item (TNT turns into Nitro, for example). It''s a simple system but it''s brilliantly effective and adds a little bit more skill where Mario Kart relies on (at times ridiculous) rubber band AI. The Adventure mode is also a good idea, and adds different themed challenges to the races, making each race experience a different one. Similar to Mario Kart, the battle mode proves to be the best mode of the game, as chaos ensues between two to four people using ridiculous weapons on eachother.</p>

<p>The only shortcoming I have with it are the small amount of weapons. This is only because we''ve been spoiled by more recent outings, though. And as it goes, CTR still holds up pretty well (in gameplay, at least - the graphics are appalling) and is available from the PlayStation Network for a very reasonably priced £3.99. Get it, it''s a classic.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', N'Wacky Racers in a game - Crash Team Racing was my favourite racer on the PS1.', N'retro corner, crash team racing, ps1, playstation, retro, gaming, nostalgia, reviews, crash bandicoot, sony, mario kart', '20110905 16:07:39', '20131125 16:07:39', 1, 1)

There is no such thing as innovation anymore and ninety percent of releases are grey-brown First Person Shooters. This is well documented in the gaming media, but what''s also been noted is the originality of Rockstar''s latest effort,&nbsp;<b>L.A. Noire</b>.</p><p>Set in post war Los Angeles (unsurprisingly), L.A. Noire is almost exactly what you''d expect it to be. It captures every aspect of the noir genre and combines it with the gritty sandbox style that has become synonymous with Rockstar games.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">The game mechanics work fairly well, with the more ridiculous elements of GTA taken out - you can only shoot in selected sections of game - and added two main gameplay parts. The first is sweeping a crime scene for clues, which is fairly good, very similar to that of </span><i style="line-height: 1.45em;">Heavy Rain</i><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">. The second mechanic, the questioning of suspects and witnesses, is much more impressive.  The facial animation technology is fantastic and some suspects are better at hiding their lies than others. The story is compelling enough to keep you going, but simple enough to follow easily and not lose interest.</span><br></p>

<p>What really turns L.A. Noire into a great game rather than a good game, though, is the cool factor. It''s extremely cool.</p>

<p>However, I don''t really see the point of the game being a sandbox. It''s clearly there just to pad out the game a little more with pointless collectibles and side missions. To be honest, the game has a lot more potential than it actually achieves, but it''s still a massive step forward in terms of original thinking.</p>

<p>Moving on to a game considerably worse, I have also recently been playing <b>Duke Nukem Forever</b>. It''s a game that I expected to be poor before I even got it, because there''s no way a game that''s been in development for thirteen years and been restarted countless times could be any good. However, it disappoints even more than expected. The old Duke Nukem games were brilliant, but Forever is just a joke, and not a very funny one at that. The shooting is average and the platforming is even worse. Some of the game is undeniably entertaining, with little jokes here and there (like seeing a never-ending spinning top whilst Duke is dreaming), but as much as I want to like it, it''s just a poor game.</p>

<p>However, what stops it from being an appalling game is the cool factor. Duke is incredibly cool. His funny one-liners keep the dialogue fresh and interesting, and using your ego as your shield is a good idea, as is expanding it by doing things like bench pressing heavy weights or checking yourself out in the mirror.</p>

<p>I hope games learn from the successes and mistakes of these two games. L.A. Noire sold considerably better than Duke Nukem Forever, and for good reason. At some point, developers will surely see that there is a clear demand for original games rather than yet more shooter clones.</p>

<p>The album''s been a long time coming, and it''s finally here, as an eclectic mix between dubstep and drum and bass. Now I''m not usually a dubstep fan but I''ve lately been coming around the idea a little more, in no small part to this album.</p>

<p>It kicks off with the fantastic <i>Doomsday</i>, which pounds into your ears as any good electronic opener should. It has more bass than is healthy and seems very Pendulum influenced (which is no bad thing). <i>My Eyes</i> follows, shifting down the rhythm substantially (as happens on many points on the album) and introduces the vocals of Alana Watson, which are rather hit and miss, but she suits this track perfectly.</p>

<p>The singles that have been released from the album are all fantastic too. <i>Guilt</i> would make a solid club track, with heavy bass and Watson''s vocals again finding themselves well suited to the music. <i>Me and You</i> is another very strong track, with a bit of rock influence mixed into the rest of the wobble bass, which isn''t overused, but just gives the track that bit of dubstep edge. <i>Innocence</i> is probably the weakest of the four singles, and isn''t really to my taste, and I feel is a good example of where Watson''s vocals don''t work as well. The final and most recent single, <i>Promises</i>, is my personal favourite and also one of the best songs on the album altogether.</p>

<p>Innocence isn''t the only song on the album that I don''t like, though. <i>Crush On You</i> is a remix of the 1985 hit by <i>The Jets</i>, which I personally don''t like either, but this is even worse. It''s a track that I will skip every single time. The final track, <i>Departure</i>, is also a little dull.</p>

<p>Despite these few poor tracks though, it''s an album that I have thoroughly enjoyed, and that''s something that''s rare to come across for me these days. The music of the early 2010s has generally been shockingly bad, and I''ve stuck to classic rock and electronic 80s (admittedly the musical talent in this genre is questionable but I think today''s music is worse). So Nero has proved to be a welcome intrusion into my reality, and I look forward to hearing more material from them.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p><span class="first">I</span>mmediate response from politicians in the wake of the recent London riots has been to blame modern communication systems such as Twitter, Mobile Phones and Blackberry Messenger for the orchestration of this violence. Is this a fair accusation?</p>

<p>In one sense, yes, because the likelihood is that these are the methods used to organise locations to group and cause violence, as statistically youths tend to use these systems to communicate normally. But that''s just it - this is the way that people communicate. Did anyone blame the postal system for the Brighton riots in the 1960s between the mods and rockers? No. If these methods did not exist, the mobs would have found another way to make the violence happen.</p>

<p>Technology has been a politician''s scapegoat for many years now and it''s about time they learnt that these systems that are built (and used) for the benefit of the majority are simply being abused by the minority. This is a recurring theme in life in general, it''s a sad fact but it is true.</p>

<p>It was reported that in Birmingham mobile internet was disabled so that people could not use BBM to organise more rioting. Whilst I can see the logic behind this, people still use SMS messaging, and this revolutionary new technology called phone calling to contact eachother - why they targeted this one system is baffling to me.</p>

<p>Twitter has come under fire before for what people have said on there, but again, it''s not Twitter''s fault. We are lucky enough to have freedom of speech in our country, and all Twitter is is a way of sharing our viewpoints with people who want to know. If some ignorant people have racist, sexist or generally controversial opinions, and they shouted it out in the middle of Parliament Square, it''s not Parliament Square''s fault because it exists for people to shout from.

Enter Roger Moore and his juddery eyebrows.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>For all his silly jovialism, I will say this for Roger Moore - he fits into the role very well, and isn''t too terrible an actor, and unlike On Her Majesty''s Secret Service, the film doesn''t fall flat because of the lack of Sean Connery.</p><p>The film couldn''t be more 1970s if it tried. It''s the closest Bond gets to blaxpoitation, and xenophobia is, again, one of the primary themes of the film - although this time it''s against a generic Carribean nation, who seem united in their aspirations to take down Britain and America. Naturally, they all worship the occult, do tarot readings and dress as if they''re in an eternal disco.</p><p>Casual racism aside, the film''s definitely one of Moore''s better entries - it''s fun whilst still a little dark, and thoroughly enjoyable throughout.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Jane Seymour''s performance as a surpsingly deep, clearly abused girl, is nothing short of brilliant. Similarly, Geoffery Holder, who plays Baron Samedi, does his part perfectly in freaking the audience out. Also, I must say, Bond looks incredibly dapper in Live And Let Die, largely down to his fantastic attire - whoever was in charge of his wardrobe did a spectacular job.</p><p>The very best line of the film comes when after Bond gives Rosie Carver a good Rogering (sorry) and then points a gun at her, demanding information else he kill her. She says ''You wouldn''t, not after what we just did,'' to which Moore replies, ''Well, I certainly wouldn''t have killed you before.&nbsp;<i>Lad.</i></p><p>He also stacks a tarot deck full of lover cards and makes Solitaire, who believes blindly in them, to pick one, just to get him to Roger his Moore.&nbsp;<i>Lad.</i></p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>I''m not sure if the attempt on Bond''s life using the Snake was meant to be a throwback to the Tarantula scene in Dr. No, but it''s awful. And the scene that follows with Rosie Carver is absolutely dreadful.</p><p>Kananga is also probably the most boring of all the villains in the franchise. His appearances in the picture are breif, unentertaining, and ultimately pointless, and his henchman TeeHee and Baron Samedi are both vastly more interesting characters.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Bond once said that ''lishening to The Beatlesh without earmuffsh'' was essentially a criminal offence, so I wonder what he thought of a Beatle doing one of the series'' most well known theme tunes. I like it for the most part until it gets to that little reggae bit in the middle, which seemed to be a necessary addition just to fit in with the Carribean theme of the film. John Barry didn''t work on this film, but his replacement, George Martain, does the remixes throughout the film and are brilliant as ever.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

I''ve been away in Egypt soaking up the rays and clinging to my last shred of freedom before I finally have to grow up.<p></p>

<p>Let me start by saying how beautiful Sharm el-Sheikh is. Rocky mountains sprout from their sandy roots and can be seen for miles around, perfectly placed for the sun to set behind them from the Nabq Bay seafront. The Red Sea is like getting into a warm bath in both temperature and depth, and you can walk out for a few hundred metres before the water raises above your knees. The sea is perfect for snorkelling and scuba diving, although I personally only tried the former.</p>

<p>The Egyptian people are some of the friendliest people I''ve ever met, but they all have something to sell, and if you''re a tourist they refuse to take "no" for an answer, so the best course of action is to avoid starting a conversation unless you intend to buy something in the first place - which we discovered the hard way.</p>

<p>The highlight for me (aside from the fantastic resort we were staying at) was Quad Biking and Sand Buggying in the Sinai - I''ve never felt so free as driving at full speed through the desert in total darkness. I know you can Quad bike anywhere but somehow doing it in 50° heat with the dust blowing in your face is much more exhilarating.</p>

<p>I''d recommend Egypt to anyone, but make sure you do a lot of research before you go, particularly into the hotels and what the food is like. The hotel I stayed at was fine, but we ate out in the desert one night and suffered from food poisoning, and it''s quite commonplace amongst the other hotels in the area. And be prepared to be bombarded by sales people constantly, but don''t let it ruin your holiday, because being in Sharm el-Sheikh is a one-of-a-kind experience that everyone should try at least once.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Other', N'I recount my amazing time at the Coral Sea Resort in Sharm, Egypt.', N'sharm el-sheikh, egypt, holidays, snorkelling, sharm temperatures, quad biking, sinai desert, food, coral sea resort', '20110801 16:47:30', '20131125 16:47:30', 1, 1)

<p><i>This is a blog I wrote for <a href="http://www.thepoliticalanimal.co.uk/">The Political Animal</a> - please check out their other interesting articles!</i></p>

<p>We are entering an era where the internet and social networking are rapidly becoming political entities in themselves, with Facebook playing David Cameron and Twitter playing Nick Clegg as it tries to be compatible to Zuckerberg’s every new update, regardless of how unpopular it is. And now a new competitor has now raised its minimalistic head and entered the race for Prime Minister of the Internet.</p>

<p>Google+ is (obviously) search engine giant Google’s latest attempt at trying to steal some of the Social Networking market that has been dominated by Facebook for years now. Previously it launched Google Wave, which was essentially a real-time multi-user document editor, which was functionally fantastic, but failed due to its limited market appeal. Although still available it has been revamped and upgraded in the form of Google Documents, which was almost exactly the same, but with more document options.</p>

<p>Plus is totally different to this, drawing almost every inspiration it has from Facebook, and putting it into a much more attractive format. The main feature is the improved privacy, being able to specify who you want to share each and every post with at the touch of a button. You can add people to individual “Circles” – essentially different categories of friends – and they can do the same to you.</p>

<p>Another feature is “Sparks” which show you articles about your interests, in a similar way to if you were to follow a Twitter account posting about them. However, one advantage it has over Twitter is that you can filter out these updates from your friend’s updates, which makes it much cleaner and easier to read. At the moment, the interests are fairly limited, but it will expand in time.</p>

<p>The chat function works considerably better than Facebook’s, with no lag, and it’s much clearer who is saying what. You also have “Hangouts” which are group voice and video chats, which is a feature that works quite well in terms of quality, but is flawed, because everyone ends up talking over each other and it’s frankly easier to use the text chat.
The “+1” system is interesting. I think it’s a good idea to be able to be able to share links from Google with the click of a button, but if you have to visit everyone’s profile to see what they’ve individually +1’d rather than it appearing in your stream, it seems a little pointless.</p>

<p>The Android app is clean, functional and very easy to use, and is far, far quicker than the Android Facebook app. It includes a very useful feature, instant upload, which uploads every photo and video you take automatically. “What!?” I hear you cry. “I don’t want EVERY picture online for everyone to see!” Fear not! It uploads them into a private album, from which you can change the settings for each individual photo or video before sharing them with whichever circles you want. The app also includes “Huddle”, which is a group chat you can have within your circles, and this feature works quite well.</p>

<p>However, where I think Google+ makes its major downfall is the lack of offline communication. If people aren’t online to talk to via chat, Huddles or Hangouts, you can’t post on their profiles, only on posts they’ve made, and this makes the whole experience feel a lot less social.</p>

<p>I can’t see Google+ being elected the new leader of social networking, as it seems to have overlooked a basic rule – you should always, always be able to contact someone on it directly, and they be notified of it. This is the case in every other social network on the internet at the moment. There’s not even a direct messaging system. I just feel that Google needs to ease up on the real-time stuff, just a little bit, else they have another failure on their hands.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Producers Saltzman and Broccoli too had a difficult relationship with the actor - at the premiere of OHMSS, they wanted Lazenby to turn up looking like 007, and so naturally the dickhead turned up with long hair and a beard.</p><p>A combination of this rocky relationship and the critical dumping of the actor as a whole, they turned to one man that they were certain wouldn''t disappoint them: Sean Connery returnsh ash Jamesh Bond.</p><p>By this time the 70s had ejaculated its shiny disco fluids all over the franchise and Diamonds Are Forever was the first film to adopt the series'' new direction of being more light-hearted and comedic.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Possibly the most sleazy of all of the James Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever has a few high points and several low points. Set half in Amsterdam and half in Las Vegas, the sleaziest locations in the whole world, 007 sleazes his way into the bed of a diamond smuggler while a sleazier, camper Blofeld and his two sleazy, gay, creepy henchmen sleaze after him.</p><p>I hope I''ve painted a sleazy enough picture there.</p><p>However, it''s still pretty entertaining, and the film benefits from having an actor that can actually act once again.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>I do actually quite like Charles Gray''s depiction of Blofeld - it''s a little bit camp and totally different to the previous representations, but he pulls it off quite well as a charismatic, arrogant villain with an unnecessarily convoluted plan.</p><p>The scene when Bond brings back one of his shlags to nob in his hotel room is pretty good, where the gangsters throw her into the pool, and Connery utters another brilliant double entendre ''I''m afraid you''ve caught me with more than my hands up!'' (He has a boner).</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are downright creepy, but that''s far from the worst part about this film. The worst part of Diamonds are Forever is the absolutely embarrassing pre-title sequence in which Bond hunts down Blofeld in revenge for killing his wife. Should be an awesome scene, but it''s just a sequence of poorly-strung together events where Bond emotionlessly traipses across the globe until he eventually finds who he believes to be Blofeld and kills him. There''s no emotion, it''s incredibly poorly edited and there''s no feeling of success or victory (possibly because it''s not actually him, but the audience isn''t supposed to know that).</p><p>Also, Tiffany Case is an absolutely god-awful Bond girl, and her character seems to directly contradict herself: when first introduced she''s shown to be sharp-witted and intelligent, but after she gets captured, she seems to lose every ounce of this and just becomes a stupid bitch in an awful bikini.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Shirley Bassey returns for Diamonds Are Forever, and, whilst it''s not as good as Goldfinger''s, it''s a pretty solid theme tune that''s a lot better than her final attempt (Moonraker).</p><p></p>

<p><span class="first">F</span>or many of us nerds and techies who got into social networking before Facebook hit it big, MySpace was the network of choice. In fact, many of us only moved over because everyone else switched to Facebook, and a social network isn''t social if there''s no-one to be social with.</p><p>The reason we used MySpace, aside from the fact that we were angsty teenagers who liked to display our mood swings using a profile song, was that it was on those fabled pages we learned to use HTML and CSS for the very first time to make our own customised profiles. However, of course, this came with a massive drawback - many people, who weren''t as technically gifted when it came to the code, created some hideous profiles. Plus the profile song did get annoying when tabbed browsing was introduced and 5 would start playing at once.<br></p>

The changes you make will be applied only to your user, so no-one else will be able to see it, but it''s nice to have something different to look at instead of the dull white and blue design.</span><br></p><p>The screenshot above is a slightly adapted version of one of the default CSS skins provided, because, as I''m sure you can imagine, creating an entire new CSS skin for Facebook from scratch takes some time, and I''m a long way from completing it yet. But it gives me something else to work on in between applying for work and Rock Star Story.</p><p>However, the skin changing is not the only impressive thing that Better Facebook brings. It filters out all of the posts in your news feed into tabs, so that posts from FarmVille, YouTube etc. no longer appear in your main feed - if you''re interested in them, you can click on a separate tab to view all posts from that application. There is also a feature called ''Friend Tracker'', which lets you know when friends drop from your lists, and who they are. You can also modify the layout of your homepage, so you can add in some new feature boxes and get rid of others (such as advertising, which frankly I''m surprised they''ve got away with). And finally, one of my favourite features is that when you hover each post you can choose to mark them as read, unread or you can just click a button and it Googles the post for you.</p><p>This is a plugin that I would highly recommend if you''re into messing around with code, and kudos go to&nbsp;<a href="http://megasin.tumblr.com/">Megasin1</a>&nbsp;for stumbling across it and showing it to me.</p><p></p>

Outside of 24, the telly is mostly reserved for a films and gaming and the odd comedy show. So when my friends began to rave about Game of Thrones, I was initially a little skeptical - how good could a medieval fantasy drama really be?</p>

<p>I''m not going to lie - the only reason I initially bothered watching it was because Sean Bean is one of my favourite actors of all time, and his role as Ned Stark sounded similar to that of Sharpe - which I never watched fully, but enjoyed the odd re-run episode that I caught. As I started watching it, however, I soon realised that it wasn''t just a great actor that would make this a fantastic series. George R. R. Martin''s world unraveled in front of me with the massive budget of HBO behind it, and it became clear that this man''s imagination could easily rival that of Tolkien''s, as Game of Thrones proved to be Lord of the Rings for grown-ups, with much more blood and nudity and a much darker, more sinister representation of what such a world would be like.</p>

<p>Whilst Bean was probably the glue that held the whole thing together, every single actor excelled in their roles, most notably perhaps Peter Dinklage, who plays the whoremongering, drunk dwarf Tyrion Lannister absolutely superbly. And <b>SPOILER ALERT</b> even when Ned Stark sadly gets his head swept off by the child king Joffrey, the show doesn''t deteriorate - in fact, the final episode is possibly the best, as the show''s fantasy elements begin to come out, and dragons rear their scaly heads.</p>

<p>I''m incredibly excited for the next series, as there are so many points to be continued from this one - the war has just begun, young Arya has begun to make her way north, and the bastard son of Stark, Jon Snow, has just gone beyond the infamous "wall" - the great enigma of the series - so we can discover what secrets lie behind it. Also, DRAGONS. I''m even tempted to begin reading the "A Song of Fire and Ice" series to see what kind of writer Martin is, and see whether or not it can match up to the big-budget experience on screen. I''ll miss Sean Bean in the next series, but there''s plenty more there to keep me interested for hopefully many series to come.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'GAME OF THRONES IS AMAZING', N'game of thrones, awesome, epic, tv, telly, sean bean, george r r martin, ned stark, peter dinklage, joffrey, tyrion, lannister, jon snow, dragons, fantasy, reviews', '20110621 14:56:25', '20131126 14:56:25', 1, 1)

Whilst he went to work on other projects, Saltzman and Broccoli had to find a replacement to continue the series, and so they went to the land down under - presumably with the mindset that Australians were just exiled Britons still.</p><p>They came back with George Lazenby, a well-built, physically tough model with absolutely no acting talent and very little experience.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Storyline-wise, it''s probably the best of the series - the screenplay is fantastic and it''s thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. The fight scenes are fantastically choreographed and Lazenby''s physical presence is his key attribute which he uses brilliantly in this scene.</p><p>Diana Rigg plays Contessa Teresa di Vincenzo to perfection as the complicated character with an obvious affection for Bond, although she hates to admit it at first, and her death shortly after their wedding is extremely touching and by far the most emotional scene of the entire franchise.</p><p>On Her Majesty''s Secret Service SHOULD be the best film in the series, but it''s not, due to one, massive, glaring flaw.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Although sad, the final 10 minutes of the film, are absolutely superb, as the scenes of complete joy from the entire cast - including Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and a touchingly tearful performance from Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny - are shattered like the glass on the windscreen of Mr and Mrs James Bond''s honeymoon car. Perhaps even more heart-wrenching is the few seconds Bond takes to realise what''s happened, before the camera reveals the bullet in Tracy''s head.</p><p>As the police bike pulls up and the instrumental version of We Have All The Time In The World plays, it takes a heart of stone not to feel anything; it''s an unparalleled level emotion that will never be seen in the series again.</p><b><h3>And the worst bit?</h3></b><p>George Fucking Lazenby.</p><p>You''d get better acting from a duck and it would suit the role better - Lazenby seems to spend the entire film trying to remember to keep up his overly stereotyped Queen''s English accent and completely forgetting to show any emotions, even when the love of his life is murdered in front of him.</p><p>The utmost worst part, though, is when he breaks the fourth wall to remind us that there was a far superior actor that we''re missing out on - ''This never happened to the other fella''. SHUT UP.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>John Barry''s work on OHMSS is probably his best. It has two ''theme tunes'' - the one that plays on the title sequence and at various points throughout the film, an epic instrumental track that sounds very ''Bond-ey'' - and We Have All The Time In The World, sung by Louis Armstrong. Both are perfectly to the film and Louis Armstrong''s track is beautiful and haunting at the same time.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Every weekend there''s been a new twist to the tale, with a new title and European challenger, and with five teams facing relegation right on the final day.</p><p>I might point out that I am primarily a Gillingham supporter, but that doesn''t stop me being a fan of Premier League teams. I like Manchester United, I like Liverpool, I like Tottenham, and I like Aston Villa. There''s nothing stopping me appreciating their style of play and the entertainment their football provides, as I have no true footballing rivalry, aside from still being incredibly bitter about the Gills losing to Manchester City in the Division Two play off in 2000.<br></p><p></p><p>Thus it might be surprising that four of the players I have selected for my best eleven are from the team which I despise. However I feel that the players selected truly have been outstanding this season, particularly Tevéz, without who Manchester City (I believe) may not have made it to the Champions League.</p><p>The last day of the season today was brilliant, with Blackpool returning to Championship, which is a disappointment, as they (unlike Manchester City) play brilliant, entertaining and positive football, and their final game against Manchester United truly summed up their season: brilliant going forward, terrible defending. Birmingham were also relegated and are playing in the Europa league from the second tier of English football - I''m not even sure if that''s ever happened before.</p><p>From condolences to congratulations, I have to tip my hat to both Wolves and Wigan, who both hit form at the exact right time. Wigan seem incapable of leaving the Premiership, having stayed up against all odds for yet another year in a row.<br></p><p></p>Looking to the transfer window in the summer, I would like to make some predictions. A big move to be expected would be a switch for Ashley Young from Villa to a bigger club, either Manchester United or Chelsea. I also think Charles N''Zogbia, the brilliant French winger for Wigan Athletic, may make a return to Newcastle, and Charlie Adam will probably return to the Premiership somehow, having made a massive impact.<p></p>
<p>I''d also like to salute Edwin Van Der Sar, who retired today, who I truly believe is one of the greatest Goalkeepers ever, up there with the ranks of Gordon Banks, Peter Schmeichel and Oliver Khan. I admired him greatly when he was at Ajax and Juventus, and he made a great impression on the English game at both Fulham and Manchester United. A true legend.<br></p><p>I''m now looking forward to next season already, hoping former Gills striker Simeon Jackson can gain a name for himself with Norwich City, seeing if QPR can take their dominance of the Championship to surviving in the Premier League, and to see if Liverpool can use their mid-year signings and Kenny Dalglish''s influence to regain their place in the ''big four'' which seems to have become a ''big six''. It''s a long time to wait, though, so for now I''ll just have to entertain myself with what should be a brilliant Champions League final next Saturday.<br></p>

University has become my life, a strange way of life, but one that was immensely enjoyable. And with the demise of my last ever exam yesterday, my career in education has come to a close.</p>

<p>I''ve been looking forward to not being educated for some time now, but actually making it this far makes you realise just how cushty life as a student is. Now I''ve got to finally grow up and join the real world. But how do I fill the void that will exist between now and finding myself a full-time job?</p>

<p>Well the most obvious thing is to enhance skills in the areas that I enjoyed most about my University course. I want to continue <a href="http://www.declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=67&amp;catid=7">Full Time Loser</a> both as a comic and hopefully some more animated episodes in future, and so I am currently working on improving my keyframed animation, as most of the first series used tweening. I''m also planning on making a mobile stylesheet for this website that''s a bit more than a white page with black text and blue links, and that doesn''t look like it was formatted by a five year old who''s just discovered you can save a Word document as a web page.</p>

<p>Right now I''m working on a very special review of Portal 2 - without giving away any hints (not that it''s difficult to figure out) - that should be up here by Sunday at the latest. I''m also going to make Sunday my official comic day, so keep your eyes peeled every Sunday for a new comic. I''ll update my twitter as per usual with any new blog updates too, as I kind of write them when the muses take me as opposed to a set date.</p>

<p>Ok, think that''s all for today, and I wish anyone who''s reading this who still has exams the very best of luck - the hard work''s worth it!</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

It''s a couple of years to go before the moon landing, so it was the perfect time for James Bond to play his new role as peacemaker between the Yanks and the Ruskies - by... faking his own death and moving to Japan?</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Whilst not orbiting at the dizzying heights of the first three films, You Only Live Twice improves massively on the awful Thunderball. Whilst the story is completely ludicrous and Connery''s performance is his most disinterested yet, it''s thoroughly entertaining and the action sequences from Bond running across a rooftop in Japan to several hundred Ninjas charging a volcano are very well done. The locations and sets are stunning, and, unlike other entries to the series, the sillyness doesn''t detract too much from the seriousness of the film.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>The climax of the film in the volcano is one of the most thrilling sequences in the series. The reveal of Blofeld, which has been built up to in three films now - is brilliantly played by Donald Pleasance, the best actor to portray him. His disfigured face and strange accent suit the character perfectly and I only wish that Pleasance had taken the role a few more times - it would make the serie''s most famous villain a much better character.</p><p>And then the ninjas arrive in their droves, and the action is frantic, non-stop and absolutely brilliant.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Like Goldfinger, discrimination is rife in You Only Live Twice - but in addition to belittling the fairer sex, this time it paints the most stereotypical portrait of the Japanese I''ve ever seen. Here''s a quick run down of the cultural aspects they show of the land of the rising sun:</p><ul><li>Paper houses</li><li>Sumo wrestlers</li><li>Ninjas</li><li>Impossible technology (you would NOT be able to get an image that high quality by zooming in!)</li><li>Chopsticks</li></ul><p>Oh, and Little Nelly is utterly ridiculous.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>A much better entry than Thunderball, Nancy Sinatra and John Barry manage to nail the Asian theme perfectly without being overtly racist or xenophobic.

But! This is not without a good reason, as the 16 months since my last website update is almost up, meaning... that''s right! Another update is coming your way, after I''ve updated content where necessary and finished testing it on all those god-awful browsers that for some reason people still use.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here''s something for the Christmas season. I did consider doing some kind of advent blog, but I''ve already missed day one, so... yeah. </p>

<p>I love the Christmas season - maybe it’s my inner child, but I can forgive all the consumerism, raised prices and the absolute hell that is shopping on Oxford Street - if only for the excuse to give people gifts, listen to cheesy music, and stuff my face with roast dinner and party food.</p>

<p>Part of my Christmas tradition is a rundown of Christmas films right up until the day itself. I''m not talking about ITV''s new tradition of showing the Harry Potter series on Christmas day, I mean proper Christmas films with Christmas as the fucking theme. The following 5 are a staple that get broken out every year.</p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><p></p><h3>5) Love, Actually</h3><p>This is one of the only romantic comedies that I really enjoy - it has a brilliant cast and - although on first watch does seem a little generic and uninspired - intertwines the ten different storylines to such a clever extent that on every rewatch you notice another connection between characters that you never realised before.</p><p>The highlight of the film is Rowan Atkinson''s brief role as a Selfridges(?) clerk. The man is hilarious and can do no wrong, I swear. Interesting piece of trivia - Atkinson''s character was originally scripted as a ''Christmas Angel''. This specific phrase was cut from the script but it''s pretty clear that the ideas remain, as he attempts to stop Alan Rickman from buying a necklace for his mistress, and distracts security to let the little kid (who grows up to play Jojen Reed) through Heathrow''s security gate to see his love, all with a knowing smile.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-12-02/Picture-5.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50"><p style="text-align:center"><i>Rick Grimes wasn''t always killing zombies</i></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p></p><h3>4) The Santa Clause</h3><p><i>The Santa Clause</i>&nbsp;is a perfect example of a recurring trope in Christmas films: the neglectful father, a divorcee, who consistently fails his son until he redeems himself through the magic of Christmas.</p><p>This time round, the magic takes form of murdering Santa Claus. A little dark. It turns out that there''s a legal contract that when you kill Santa Claus, you must put on his suit, and henceforth every December you put on ten stone, grow an infinite beard and deliver presents. Hence the law term, Santa Claus<strong>e</strong>. It''s very witty.</p><p>It''s about as generic as you can get - it''s basically&nbsp;<i>Liar Liar</i>&nbsp;at Christmas - but as generic Christmas films go, it''s probably my favourite.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-12-02/timallan.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p style="text-align:center"><i>I Saw Mummy Doing Coke with Santa Claus</i></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-50" style=""><p></p><h3>3) Elf</h3><p>Will Ferrell plays Will Ferrell, which is fine if you like Will Ferrell but not if you hate Will Ferrell. Either way, I quite like Will Ferrell and Will Ferrell is particularly Will Ferrell in&nbsp;<em>Elf</em>.</p><p>The story of a human raised as a magical elf at the north pole,&nbsp;<em>Elf</em>&nbsp;is another film with a neglectful father who spends all his time at work, only to redeem himself in his son''s eyes through the joy of Christmas. It''s a completely family-friendly film, although it''s focused at a much broader audience than just children in comparison to some of the other Christmas films out there.</p><p>The best part of the film is probably when he calls Peter Dinklage an elf and the (P)imp flips out on him.</p><p>With its wacky sense of humour, it''s probably the most endearing of all the films on this list, and if you like Ferrell''s other work (e.g. The Campaign, Zoolander, Anchorman) there''s no reason you wouldn''t like&nbsp;<em>Elf</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

Back in the days when Bruce Willis had hair and Alan Rickman''s natural speaking voice could pass for German.</p><p>Yes, I know I said I was only going to include films with Christmas at the main theme, BUT it is on Christmas Eve and a Christmas party that''s hijacked, so I say it''s a Christmas film.

Period. Ignore the fact that on paper it''s a relatively crap film with a poor script full of bad acting and tropes galore, it''s a kid''s Christmas film with Arnie in it and that trumps everything.</p><p>In all seriousness it''s a brilliantly entertaining film and it''s almost ''so bad it''s good'', but not quite that bad so it''s kind of good. If that makes sense. Arnie''s hijinks as Turboman is a precious childhood memory of mine and as a kid I wanted nothing more than a ''Turhbohman daahhl'' and there are gems such as ''PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN!'' make this a must watch, year in, year out.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<p>It''s a simple style sheet that you can apply to any website you''re developing to detect any errors in the markup.

<p>One such game was Spyro the Dragon, released in 1998 for the PlayStation One. My first experience was with a demo free with a magazine I used to read, and I was hooked on the first level. The bright style and nonsense-based story that have become synonymous with Insomniac Games appealed greatly to me as an eight year-old but still retain their childish charm to this day.</p>

<p>The game is essentially the ultimate collect-a-thon, typical of the platformers of the 32-bit era, and there''s a real desire to get to 100%. However, the problem is that this is far too easy, simply because the mechanics don''t have enough variation to them. There are only two different characteristics to enemies and puzzles, flame or charge, and when you compare this to other platformers of the era such as the incredibly deep and complex <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, the game seems a little dull.</p>

<p>However, this lack of complexity doesn''t stop it being an incredibly entertaining few hours even now, and the graphics hold up strangely well for a game that''s thirteen years old, but it makes you glad that camera control has evolved.</p>

<p>I would expect that most of you would have played this at some point, but if you haven''t and you own a PS3, keep your eye on the PSN store or see if you can get a copy of eBay, because it''s a distraction that''s well worth an investment.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', N'A retrospective view of Spyro the Dragon, a classic platformer for the PlayStation 1.', N'retro corner, spyro the dragon, ps1, spyro, playstation, sony, retro, nostalgia, platformer, gaming, reviews', '20110418 12:25:44', '20131209 12:25:44', 1, 1)

I haven''t played a Mortal Kombat since number 2, and although that was cool in a goretastic eye-burning way, it was hardly the best fighter ever, and (apparently) the 3D versions were absolutely atrocious.</p>

<p>However the latest version is a side-on beat em'' up, the way it should be, in 2 dimensions but in glorious 3D graphics. And let''s start with those graphics.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat has been known the world over for its incredible gore, in particular the fatalities where they rip people apart, limb from limb, flesh from bone. And in high definition, the action and gore that should be repulsive to us as human beings is incredible to behold and somehow satisfying. The attention to detail is marvelous, with each character having their own designed innards and bones (again, disgusting, yet entertaining... for some reason).</p>

<p>The gameplay is a typical arcade-style fighter, and the main advantage it has over other similar fighters e.g. <i>Soul Calibur</i> or <i>Tekken</i> is that it nails the difficulty <b>perfectly</b>. If you play through the story mode (which I might add, has perfect transition between cutscenes and fights unlike I have ever seen) you will see the difficulty rise so between each chapter but no so exponentially that it would take more than a few goes to beat the round, aside from the bosses, which are extremely challenging but not to the point of impossible.</p>

<p>Having said all of this, I have doubts about the longevity of it. I mean, it''s not something you''re going to be playing every day for the rest of the year, but I think that''s true of most beat em'' ups. Once you''ve finished the story, done a few arcade ladders and just messed around with fatalities, it''ll probably turn into one of those games you break out when the friends are down.

Connery returned to the fray, but by this point he was showing signs of being slightly bored of the role.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>Thunderball is the first film in the series that is a little bit shit. In fact, I''d say it held the rather undistinguished position of worst Bond flick for 43 years. It''s easy to see where the budget was blown: around half an hour of the film is underwater, which must have commanded a fair amount of the $9 million (around £90 million in today''s money and in the right country), as I expect most of the actors would have needed extensive diving lessons, expensive scuba equipment and of course decent cameras that could capture underwater perfectly.</p><p>But the underwater segments are boring, slow, and confusing. In videogames, even the best ones, underwater levels are consistently the worst - a prime example being the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time - and if Thunderball is anything to go by, underwater and film don''t go together either.</p><p>Connery seems a little more arrogant and disinterested in the role this time around, and although Bond needs to have a certain swagger about him, there''s a point at which it stops being suave and appealing, instead making him seem like a complete twat.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>Despite my little rant there, Thunderball isn''t all bad - it''s got some fantastic bits. The pre-title sequence with the jetpack is one of the series'' best, if a little disconnected from the story - the jetpack one of Bond''s best gadgets, albeit somewhat fantastical (where was he hiding that thing anyway?).</p><p>Luciana Paluzzi also excels as sultry, big-boobed assassin Fiona Volpe, and the scene in which she shoots down 007''s sexual prowess is nothing short of a stroke of genius. A perfect femme fatale, she makes for one of the more interesting Bond girls, and not just because of her chest.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>The thirty or so minutes spent underwater is simply terrible. I completely lose concentration, because you can''t figure out who''s on what side, and all of these people are being killed by harpoon but as far as the audience knows, it could have just been some traveller lazily swimming through as he experiences the coral reef of the Carribean for the first time. There''s no character empathy as I had no idea who the hell they were. It goes on for too long and it feels like a chore to watch - there''s no entertainment to be found in what must have been a budget-busting sequence.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>The worst (almost) Bond film also commands the worst (almost) theme tune (both being surpassed in 2008). Tom Jones sings nonsensical lyrics over a melody that sounds more like a parody of the series rather than what it''s supposed to (although this might not be John Barry''s fault, rather Mike Myers). The less said about Thunderball, both the music and the film, the better. Avoid.</p><p></p>

It''s got everything the series is well known for in abundance - out-of-this-world and yet still realistic gadgets, several women that Bond lies with who, alas, meet their doom shortly thereafter, an unbeatably tough henchman (this time he''s Korean and has a nifty hat), an evil &amp; ruthless yet somewhat likeable villain, and tension, action and double entendres (Pussy) galore.</p><p>One decision that was made that I feel was very good was the removal of SPECTRE - Saltzman and Broccoli quickly realised that not all of Bond''s assignments should be masterminded by Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and that some diversity would be good for the series.</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>The scene where 007 is tied to a solid gold table whilst a laser threatens to tear his body entwain, cock first, is possibly the most tension-inducing scene in the history of cinema. For the first time ever, we see Bond lose his cool and nonchalant attitude to death, and it is in this scene that Connery displays his finest acting in the role: the subtle panicking as he throws out random phrases he has heard in conversation, and the sheer relief as Goldfinger eventually, and foolishly, listens to him and turns the laser off.</p><p>And let''s not forget the ejector seat - although the special effects are dated the hilarity remains, (if only caused by the unnamed henchman''s comedy scream) one of the franchise''s most genuinely funny moments.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>Now I''m not adverse to the odd bit of light-hearted discrimination - but the sexism on display here is on the borderline. The whole film toes the line very carefully, but when Connery slaps Dink''s arse and says ''Man talk'' to get her to leave, it shows just how large the power gap between genders was in the sixties.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Shirley Bassey''s first of three Bond themes is undoubtedly her best, and the music and lyrics both fit the picture''s antagonist superbly - it definitely feels like Auric Goldfinger''s theme tune, helped in no small measure by another superb arrangement by John Barry.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

With the cold war in full flow and (largely thanks to the previous film) spies and secrets all the rage, Saltzman and Broccoli decided that From Russia With Love should be the next adaptation. With a doubled budget - and a double paycheck for returning star Sean Connery - we are taken on a journey of SMERSH, SPECTRE and other confusingly similar acronyms.</p><h3><b>So, is it any good?</b></h3><p>From Russia With Love took the formula that had worked so well from Dr. No and built upon it with astounding efficiency. New stereotypical Bond characters were introduced - the villanous girl whom turns to the side of England because of Bond''s magnificent British penis, and the ridiculously buff henchman that you couldn''t dent with a sledgehammer.</p><p>It not only betters its predecessor, but it blows it clean out of the Soviet submarine-infested water - the magnificent sidekick Kerim Bey is a hundred times better than Quarrel (although Connery still has issues pronouncing his name correctly) and the storyline as a whole is considerably deeper than Dr. No''s, and a hundred times more entertaining.</p><p>Plus we have my favourite double entendre of the entire series - ''I think my mouth is too big.'' ''It''s the right size... for&nbsp;my cock&nbsp;me that is!''</p><h3><b>What''s the best bit?</b></h3><p>In a film with so many standouts, it''s difficult to pick a favourite aspect: but I personally am a massive fan of Red Grant and every scene he appears in. Built like a skyscraper, well-spoken, cold, intelligent and just an ever-so-slight hint of psychosis, he''s everything a good villain should be, and Robert Shaw portrays him brilliantly.</p><p>Grant and Bond''s fight on the Trans-Siberian Express is a classic action scene, typifying the English people''s opinion of Russia in a few minutes: trains and communists. I also think that 007''s do-everything suitcase is one of the best gadgets he''s ever had - hell, I want a suitcase that''s got 100 quid hidden in it and disperses gas at anyone who opens it!</p><p>And let''s not forget Tatiana Romanava, one of my favourite Bond girls for her story more than anything - and the first of many to betray mother Russia for thirty seconds of Connery inside her. Daniela Bianchi displays her difficulties of choosing between cock and country very well indeed.</p><h3><b>And the worst bit?</b></h3><p>There''s no part of From Russia With Love that I''d consider to be bad, but seeing as I have to choose a worst bit, it would have to be the ending - as James and Tatianasit in front of a greenscreen at Pinewood Studios&nbsp;sail down the Venitian Rivieira, Bond looks at stills of a sex tape he inexplicably obtained of the pair of them, and then throws it into the river. It''s just so poorly edited and feels rushed compared to the rest of the film, and I am of the opinion that the ending of a movie should be memorable for being good.</p><h3><b>What about the theme tune?</b></h3><p>Matt Munro''s crooning vocals are fantastic, and the first ''proper'' Bond theme is one of the best. Composed by Lionel Bart, it''s sombre without being depressing, and has that ''Fallout'' vibe about it. It''s also the first film legendary composer John Barry worked on, and he began his tradition of implementing the theme song into the instrumental music of the film, pulling it off superbly.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100" style=""><p>Moving swiftly on and focusing on the positives, though, the shortlist includes the immersive Heavy Rain, which would probably have won if it had a little more replayability, and Fallout: New Vegas (which is basically Fallout 3 set in Vegas, so immediately it''s going to be extremely high up). I would love to give the award to LittleBigPlanet 2, which is absolutely fantastic, but that''s a 2011 game and so will probably win the award this time next year. However the winner for 2010 is&nbsp;<b>Gran Turismo 5</b>, an absolutely superb racing game which incorporates both simulation and arcade elements perfectly, coupled with truly astonishing graphics, and a sense of realism unmatched by any other driving simulator to date.<br></p><hr></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><p></p><h3><b>AWARD THREE: FILM OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>After the appalling mess that was 2009 in film, 2010 was much brighter. It wasn''t just limited to the summer blockbusters, either. Kick-Ass was a brilliant tribute to comic book heroes, Dinner For Schmucks and The Other Guys were refreshingly stupid comedies, and Tim Burton provided us with his take on Alice In Wonderland. Then there was Toy Story 3, a fantastic end to possibly the best trilogy of films ever, and the not-so-good-but-still-incredibly-entertaining Machete and The Expendables. But - of course - the award goes to&nbsp;<b>Inception</b>&nbsp;which has already staked its claim for best film of the 2010s.

The first Portal game took a tired FPS genre and injected it with puzzles that make you think, and a brilliant sort of mini-story to boot - the cake is a lie. LittleBigPlanet 2 - although I already own it, is technically this year - is a fantastic game that already owns everything that came out last year. Uncharted 3: Drake''s Deception promises to take the brilliance of Uncharted 2 and build and improve upon it. My game of 2009, Arkham Asylum, is expecting a sequel in the form of Arkham City. But topping all of these, making me sick like a child is&nbsp;<b>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</b>. Before too long I will do a feature on the Zelda series and just why I love it so much, and why I think that Skyward Sword may finally replace Ocarina of Time in my heart as the best game ever.</p><hr><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2013-12-09/gds.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-66" style=""><p></p><h3><b>AWARD FIVE: BEST DOWNLOADABLE GAME OF THE YEAR</b></h3><p>I intend to add a new award every year I do this, and this year, with the rise of the iPhone market, it seems apt to include downloadable games. Let me be clear about the boundaries for this: they have to be solely available via download.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p></p><p>So games that are also available on disc - e.g. Burnout Paradise, WipEout HD, GTA etc, do NOT count. It can range from any game on iOS, Android, PSN, XBLA, WiiWare etc. There have indeed been some very impressive candidates this year. Shank is a good side-scrolling beat-em-up but reminds me a little too much of the sort of Flash games I used to play online, e.g. Alien Hominid. A better candidate is Sonic 4: Episode 1, which (although a little too short) finally goes back to the series'' roots. People have complained that nothing has been added, but in my view, why fix something that ain''t broke?</p><p>The winner, though, cost me £1.50 in a sale for my Xperia.&nbsp;<b>Game Dev Story</b>&nbsp;is a brilliantly addictive strategy game that puts many full-sized games to shame. In the same vein as Theme Park or Theme Hospital, you take charge of a company, and try and make a ridiculous amount of money. However GDS is a lot deeper than both the aforementioned and has that ''just one more go'' factor that is missing in so many games today.</p><hr><p>Well, there you have it.

The World trailer was that it looked like a tacky, trashy with far too many unnecessary visual effects. The trailer did not make me laugh once and quite frankly the film looked appalling.</p><p>So I didn''t go and see the film, but all of my friends did and returned to me lavishing it with praise. They told me it was full of videogame references and sound effects that made it not only funny, but cool too. And I played the video game which I cannot deny is brilliantly stylised (even if the gameplay is relatively average). After these two massive boosts to Scott Pilgrim''s ego I thought maybe I should finally watch it rather than dismissing it altogether.</p><p>Whilst the film is not even close to being as terrible as I thought it would be, my friends lied to me and my opinion of their opinions has dropped dramatically. </p><p>The main issue is that the visual effects are far too frequent and often not that cool, like the text that accompanies every single scene change and sound effect, and those stupid hearts as well. However there are some hilarious effects, such as the use of the Commodore64 startup sound used to censor the swearing (a rather geeky one), the way the evil ex drops coins and points after he''s KO''d, and the Universal logo music is 8-bit, which frankly is the best bit of the film. </p><p>I didn''t find the film particularly funny (although that''s not to say I didn''t laugh at all) but it can certainly be entertaining, and the music and sound is fantastic, but it will take more than a few videogame references to make a movie good. </p><p>The actual storyline itself adds to the tackiness with the seven evil exes - it makes a mockery out of traditional gaming values in a shameful attempt to pander to American high school girls. It certainly doesn''t help that I absolutely hate Michael Cera. He is a very poor actor who plays himself in every film - but himself is a dick and the idea of him playing somebody with any hint of hardness to their character is frankly laughable.</p><p>If you want to watch a film that pays homage to comic books, go for Kick-Ass -it''s literally hundreds of times better than this.

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col col-100"><p><span class="first">I</span> did see Inception back in the summer when it came out, but I just watched it again for the second time and wanted to write about it when it was fresh in my mind. There seem to be two distinct camps of opinion regarding Christopher Nolan''s summer blockbuster: those who think it is one of the best films of all time, and those who can''t grasp why it has been so greatly hyped. Personally, I am in the former.</p><p>Having said that, it''s not difficult to see why people didn''t like it that much. The plot is incredibly complex and unless you pay attention to every frame and syllable you could miss something vital that confuses you for the rest of the film - it''s definitely not an easy watch. However I don''t think ignorance of the plot is a justifiable excuse to not enjoy a visual masterpiece. The special effects and action sequences - whilst not particularly complicated - are very innovative, with the giant cities of dreams being manipulated and twisted and the brilliant zero-gravity fight scene providing a brilliant spectacle.</p><p>Another criticism levelled at Inception is that it portrays dreams too logically, and that it does not show the "madness" that could happen by going into someone''s dreams. I have two issues with this - firstly, that of course such an abstract concept could be interpreted in many different ways, and Nolan wasn''t trying to show the "madness" or whatever, so frankly I consider that a moot point. The second argument I have is that the logic behind it is what makes it good. It takes someone highly intelligent to take something so abnormal and apply all these normal aspects of life to it as metaphors for dreams. If it was some ridiculously out-there plot that used metaphors without any meaning, it would frankly be crap. But the best part of this film is how set in real life it actually seems despite not being set in reality for the majority of it, and with metaphors such as the spinning totem being placed spinning never ending in Mal''s mind, meaning that it was always there in "the back of her mind". Yes it''s literal. But it makes perfect sense. Deal with it.</p><p>Despite the lavish amount of praise I could throw at this film, I do have a couple of minor points to make about the filming itself (which I didn''t expect). With such a complicated storyline, I expected that the second time through would be a lot more enjoyable because I wouldn''t have to concentrate as much. I was dismayed to find that my stupid analytical brain instead noticed a couple of contradictions which bug me a little bit. A couple were so ridiculously minor that I can''t even remember them, just a couple of mismatched shots here and there that were honestly barely noticeable. But the main thing that niggles is that before Cobb said to Mal that they had grown old together and the little montage of them with old wrinkled hands walking around their subconscious together is shown, their suicide scene is already shown with their heads on the rails, barely a day older than in real life.</p><p>Again, it''s a relatively minor point, but it still bugs me. Some might argue that it''s in a dream within a dream, blah blah blah, but I don''t think so. I think it''s just a small oversight that will irritate a few people like myself who still enjoyed the film spectacularly.</p><p>Nolan''s film is in itself a massive maze, one of the most important metaphors in the film, but one that when you''ve navigated successfully, is very rewarding. You could take it literally in that when you get to the centre of the maze you''re stuck with the final shot of the spinning top, wondering whether or not it toppled and so you''ve never truly found the way out of the plot, because you don''t actually know how it ends.</p><p>He managed to come up with what will become one of the greatest questions in cinema history, though: Did the totem drop? The answer is it doesn''t matter. The point is you don''t know. If we saw it topple, it would be shit. If it didn''t stop, it would have "it was all a dream" and it would have been shit. Instead he keeps the audience guessing.</p><p>And just like the rest of this film, it''s a stroke of genius.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'Inception is one of the best films ever, and Christopher Nolan is a visionary.', N'inception, good films, christopher nolan, review, declan tyson', '20110114 17:06:29', '20131209 17:06:29', 1, 1)

It was the perfect time for Fleming''s creation to be born, and born he was, bursting from the of the pages of a book and into the shining bright lights of cinema.</p><p>To play the character, the manliest of men, you needed someone with sex appeal, machismo, and a strong physical presence. Sean Connery and his strangest of accents fit the bill perfectly - he had a presence that men and women alike found irresistable.</p><b><h3>So, is it any good?</h3></b><p>A stunning first entry into what was to become a stunning series, Dr. No would establish many (although not all) of 007''s key themes and ideals. From start to finish, it''s tense, action-packed, sexy and funny. In Connery''s first outing as Bond he fits the role effortlessly, and the film''s locations across the Carribean are beautiful and fantastic - every aspect of it makes you envious of Bond''s life.</p><p>It''s by no means perfect - the script is a little bit weaker than some other entries in the series but it''s still a fantastic place to start from, and for a few films the series would go from strength to strength.</p><b><h3>What''s the best bit?</h3></b><p>Without trying to sound cliché, it has to be the classic scene of Honey Ryder emerging from the sea in that incredibly revealing bikini. At the time it was unseen to have that much flesh on show, and Ursula Andress became an instant sex symbol. Despite the fact that now her attire may be slightly dated, she''s become iconic, and the archetypal Bond girl.</p><p>But that''s not the only good scene - when Bond introduces himself to Sylvia Trench is a masterclass in character introduction. Remaining unseen while he kicks the shit out of her at cards, he simultaneously condescends and compliments her, before returning her own introduction back at her while the James Bond theme tune (you''ve got to remember the guy has a fucking theme tune) plays over Connery''s cool, suave and seductive delivery of ''Bond... Jamesh Bond.''</p><p>And the tarantula scene is a superb demonstration of how tension can be built by music and a massive hairy spider crawling over you.</p><b><h3>And the worst bit?</h3></b><p>While not poor as such, I''m not a huge fan of Dr. No himself as a villian - he''s not in it for long enough to make an impact and his death is a little anti-climactic. Although to be honest, anyone with robot hands that crush everything is definitely intimidating. It''s a wonder he didn''t rip his cock off after seeing Ursula Andress getting showered off.</p><b><h3>What about the theme tune?</h3></b><p>Unless you count The James Bond Theme itself, Dr. No doesn''t have a theme tune. But let''s focus on that most well-known of all 007''s music - it has the grand vibe of orchestral cinema whilst having the sting of the 60''s in it. It''s a little bit cheesy, it''s a little bit sneaky, it''s a little bit epic, it''s perfect in every single way.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

My initial response was that of joy - maybe there can finally be a decent shooter amongst the wave of mediocrity that plagues this generation (Halo excluded, of course). In my opinion, the first person shooter genre died with Free Radical. Halo and Timesplitters were the last standout series in a genre that was rapidly becoming stale and tired.</p><p>So who would be kicking developers to begin making proper shoot ''em ups again? ...Activision. Oh dear.</p><p></p>

But for some reason it still sells like hotcakes, so maybe there''s something I''m missing, but I don''t really want to find out what that is. It annoys me that a company that already has three goldmine series - Guitar Hero, World of Warcraft and COD - can be so greedy that it needs to have the Bond games too. I preferred when EA had everything, frankly - at least they released a variety of average games.</span><br></p><p>Anyway, rant about greedy publishers over, I was also sceptical of the redesign of the game - it was no longer soviet, with Daniel Craig as the lead, and had taken a somewhat futuristic approach akin to the poor Quantum of Solace. Nevertheless, my policy is to give anything a chance, and whilst I wouldn''t say I was pleasantly surprised, the game is definitely a lot more fun than I expected. Every bad point had a good point.</p><p>The engine is solid and quite quick, although a little clunky at times. The weapons are strong enough not to feel like you''re just firing runners at your enemies without bein ridiculously overpowered like the pistol with double zoom in the original Halo. The melee, however, is extremely overpowered, with a maximum two-hit kill. The game is a little too easy, and there''s not as much stealth as the original - it will take a group of 20+ enemies to stop a simple run and gun assault, unless you''re on 00 Classic difficulty which ditches chargeable health in favour of body armour, which frankly, makes the game a lot more enjoyable and challenging. </p><p>The level design, however, is truly shocking. It''s completely linear, which would be fine, but there''s literally nowhere in each level to find new, exotic weapons. This translates to the multiplayer, too, which is a massive disappointment. Again, it''s solid and undeniably fun, but the novelty soon wears off without all the secret passages and multiple rooms of the original - the levels are tiny, without any tension or stealth. On top of this, you can choose literally any weapon as your loadout, so there''s no incentive to explore the level and find something better, and after a while everyone starts camping and it gets dull. It''s lazy development, frankly.</p><p>If you come into this game as a totally different game to the original, it''s still an example of a tired genre struggling to find new ideas, but it''s fun to pull out every now and again. But don''t expect a classic, because it doesn''t come remotely close to the original.</p>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable" style=""><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-75" style=""><p>I&nbsp;go into this review with a fair amount of bias. As I Lay Dying are one of my favourite bands, and alongside such bands as All That Remains and Killswitch Engage, pioneered the metalcore genre. However with their most recent outing they have veered away from traditional metalcore by combining it with thrash. On their last album,&nbsp;<i>An Ocean Between Us</i>, elements of this were evident, but now, essentially, they do not belong to the genre of music that they were once so important in.<br></p><p>This is by no means a bad thing. Metalcore is a genre that is often very repetitive and similar between various artists, and full credit to AILD for branching out and trying something new.<br></p><p>Does it work? Yes, brilliantly.<br></p>
</div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-25" style=""><p><i>Of course, since I wrote this review frontman Tim Lambesis has been arrested for paying someone to murder his wife, with fairly conclusive evidence. I''d like to point out my appreciation of his musicianship does not transfer to an apparently steroid-fueled crime.</i></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">But it is nowhere near as accessible as any of their other albums. The first track, Beyond Our Suffering, immediately sets the tone - absolutely brutal guitar riffs and drum beats while Tim Lambesis'' voice rips through without melodic interludes. It''s almost as heavy as back from their grindcore days of </span><i style="line-height: 1.45em;">Beneath The Encasing of Ashes</i><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">, which gives off a vibe instantly as to what the album is like. It''s followed up by Anodyne Sea, which is closer to the AILD that I know so well, but it combines with their new thrash influences to create a superb blend of melody and anger.</span><br></p><p>Then you have Without Conclusion, which is this album''s Within Destruction - you can hear Slayer''s influence attacking your ears with brutal force. Around this point it is a good time to note that one of the main strengths of this band is the consistency of their improvement over their albums, and The Powerless Rise is no exception. If you compare WC with WD you will hear that the guitars are sharper, drums are faster, and the entire band is beautifully harmonised.</p><p>Parallels reintroduces the glorious metalcore breakdown that is almost defining of the genre, and if you''re not physically headbanging, you''re doing it over and over in your mind. The chorus is catchy and the lyrics, typical of AILD, are incredibly deep and well written - <i>''We are not the same, as I hope to show, there is a better way if we just let go...''</i></p><p>After almost no break from the action, it cuts to The Plague, which is one of the best songs on the album. It''s extremely fast paced, and the multiple layers of vocals (at times almost sound a bit Cradle of Filth-ey) add an extra depth that was missing from earlier work on <i>Frail Words Collapse</i>. It, too, has a good breakdown, and then breaks into a fantastic solo full of harmonics and pitch shifts, completely changing the pace of the song, before suddenly heading back into the relentless rampage.</p><p>We then go to what, in my opinion, is the weakest song on the album. As big a fan as I am of AILD, I have to admit that they often have some filler material on their albums, and this song is indeed filler material. It just doesn''t sound very good - the introduction riff is a little iffy, and then the rest of the song is rather repetitive, although the chorus is good. It''s then immediately followed by another weaker song, Condemned, which, although better, is rather forgettable. It''s one of the heavier songs on the album but unlike Beyond Our Suffering or The Plague,  just doesn''t deliver the full package.</p><p>However after two weak tracks they strike back with an absolutely incredible one. The introduction is fantastic, with the drums and the bass guitar slowly building you up, before the guitar comes in and then slowly guides you through the rest of the first minute, and then Tim starts screaming and the pace increases tenfold. The next three minutes has it all - a great breakdown, fantastic riffs, and a chorus that doesn''t make a lot of sense but it so catchy it''s unreal (<i>''Simplicity is not a curse when strength is humbled and the powerless rise''</i>...?).</p><p>The next three songs (Vacancy, The Only Constant Is Change, and The Blinding Of False Light) are all very good songs as well, although they''re not the best on the album, and they''re not the best songs the band could come up with, I''m sure.</p><p>Perhaps it''s just got too much to live up to, but there''s something a little disappointing about this album. I think it''s because, as I previously mentioned, As I Lay Dying''s albums normally get better each time, but when I compare <i>The Powerless Rise</i> to <i>An Ocean Between Us</i>, I can''t honestly say it''s better. It''s really not. Yes, the musicianship is better, Jordan Mancino must have broken about 50 pedals in the making of it, but it''s just not as good to listen to.</p><p>I don''t want to end on a sour note, because this is a truly amazing album - the band have just set their standards far too high for me to judge it fairly.</p>

The connection in the top of the phone stopped working after I clumsily knocked it on the floor whilst charging it. So the moral of this story is be careful with the charger.</b><br></span></p><p><span class="first">I</span> was lucky enough to be able to get a new smartphone when my contract ran out last Wednesday. I purchased the new(ish) Sony Ericsson Xperia X10, because I refuse to buy an Apple product ever (both because I don''t like them and out of sheer principle) and because my thumbs are too fat to operate the keypad on a BlackBerry. For those interested, the contract''s pretty good - with O2, £50 for the handset, unlimited texts, 300 minutes and 500MB data plus free wifi, all for £30 a month.</p><p>So given my problems with BlackBerrys, you might wonder how my monstrous digits cope with a touch screen full keyboard, as you too may suffer from a similar ailment. The answer is slightly better but I still have some slight issues. The most irritating one is when you try and press space and end up hitting the full stop key which is inexplicably placed next to it, and it''s a pain in the arse to go back and correct a sentence like "ok.see.you.in a.bit." because the arrow buttons are too small and next to the full stop key also. However I''m slowly learning, and the dictionary function works very well, and most typos I have made have been greeted with the correct suggestion. </p><p>The touch screen itself is not as sensitive as an iPhone but in my opinion this is a good thing as I am slightly heavy-handed. Sometimes it''s a little unresponsive but the vast majority of the time it works perfectly, and was surprisingly easy to get used to after using a normal mobile phone. It looks beautiful, both the hardware and software.</p><p>Speaking of software, it runs on an Android OS, which I absolutely adore. The app store - whilst not as extensive as Apple''s - has just about all the free apps you could ever need, and there are a quite a few interesting looking paid ones but I haven''t used any of them yet. One of the selling points of the Xperia was the Timescape app, which collates your email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter updates in a very pretty format. However, to be perfectly honest, it''s slow to load and update and it''s often easier just to open the up the dedicated app or browser. However it does look very nice and it''s good to have on the home screen displaying the latest update.</p><p>As a media player it''s pretty good, but it does have some downfalls which are making me consider downloading an alternative app to Mediascape. Mediascape is a little on the slow side, but that''s not enough to bother me. The main issue is that you have to go through several screens just to get to your library sorted in a different way to "Recently Added" or "Recently Played". Also, it lacks Last.fm scrobbling ability, but again, this is only a minor point.</p><p>When I read the reviews, one thing that was mentioned was the battery life, quoted as around 8 hours use. This is about accurate - you definitely need to charge it up every day, especially if you''re using Wifi, which drains a lot of the battery. To me this isn''t an issue but it''s not ideal for someone who needs to use their phone constantly, e.g. for business, so a BlackBerry might be of better use if that''s your intention.</p><p>Messaging is good, about as advanced as something as straightforward as SMS can be, and call quality is extremely clear, if a little quiet. The camera is good too, 8.1 Megapixels with face recognition etc, etc, although it''s still not as good quality as a proper digital camera. The one feature it is majorly lacking is multi-touch, which means it is not compatible with some of the many emulators and applications available on Android.</p><p>Do I like this phone? Yes, I love it. Would I recommend it? A harder question. I think most people will prefer an iPhone or BlackBerry, but if we were to take these two out of the question, it''s definitely better than most other smartphones currently on the market. So if, like me, you hate Apple and have swollen phalanges, this is the smartphone for you. If not, it probably isn''t.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Tech and Design', N'A review of the Xperia X10''s suitability to everyday life.', N'sony ericsson, xperia x10, review, practicality, charger issues', '20101015 17:12:23', '20131210 17:12:23', 1, 1)

This was my response.</p><p>American Dad''s characters are full of much more depth than FG''s. They all have their basic traits but when faced with situations they deal with it in their own way. FG used to do this but now it would just make a gay joke or introduce a country singer or start singing Surfin'' Bird with no resolution to the problem. The storytelling in FG is second to running gags, a lot of which were never funny in the first place. AD has literally no running gags aside from a few within each episode, and they are never bought up again later. American Dad is also far more intelligent in it''s joke telling and, while it still makes reference to popular culture, does so in a way that''s a lot more subtle and therefore funnier. Also, the lack of cutaways in AD allows for more actual jokes rather than cheap filler that''s often not funny at all.</p><p>Also, let''s compare characters. Stan &gt; Peter anyday, Peter''s just fat whereas Stan has a lot more dimension to his personality. Lois doesn''t seem to have a set personality, as it changes from episode to episode whereas Francine is always the loving housewife who deals with her ridiculous husband throughout all the problems. Chris is barely in FG anyway, and Steve has his own personality PLUS all of his friends, all of whom are hilarious, although I admit that Toshi''s part is simply cheap racism. But it''s still funny. Meg''s shit, everyone knows that, even the producers, but Hayley has an agenda, a slutty personality and anger management issues. Win. Brian is a serious character who very rarely says anything witty anymore, instead bashing around his liberal policies, but everything the German fish Klaus says is pure comedy gold.</p><p>And finally, even FG''s best character Stewie has stopped being the hilarious evil genius inhibited by his infantile instincts and instead has just become a cheap gay laugh. Roger the alien may do simple drunk humour but at least he''s been that way from start to finish, and he still has a lot more dynamics to his personality than this.</p><p>There.

Entertainment that should last longer than 10 minutes. FUEL is a racing game by Codemasters - the people who created Micro Machines, my personal favourite 2D racing game of all time. It is quite clear to me that most, if not all, of that groundbreaking team has long since gone. Let''s go through how FUEL advertises itself on the back cover and pick holes in it:</p><ul><li>"EXTREME RACING": The racing is about as extreme as using a purple bin bag instead of a black one. It''s slow, dull, and relies almost solely on luck. All you can do is hold accelerate and turn when required, which is simple enough, but sometimes you can have a perfect race and the AI will still be over a kilometre ahead of you by the end. Alternatively, you could crash on every corner of the race and still manage to win. It''s quite bizarre, it''s not quite rubber band AI - it''s far too random for that.</li><li>"EPIC SCALE": The game arena is 14,000 kilometres squared. To give you a rough idea of how big this is, it''s about the size of Northern Ireland. This is fucking ridiculous. Yes, a large game world is good, but there''s a limit - you''ll never, ever, ever learn your way around this game world without using the terrible navigator. I mean, there''s only a few people - if anyone - who knows their way around Northern Ireland, and NI actually looks different in different parts, whereas the FUEL world looks exactly the same in every single zone. This takes away the whole point of exploration. There''s nothing to explore because everything looks the same, and you won''t be able to find your way back anyway. It doesn''t matter how pretty it is, it''s too big. They''d have been far better off making a smaller world with more stuff in it.</li><li>"FEARSOME WEATHER": The occasional light shower does not count as fearsome.</li><li>"75 VEHICLES": They all handle terribly, most of them are slow and the ones that aren''t don''t work off-road. And there''s not much road.</li><li>"190 CHALLENGES": They''re all variations of drive from A to B, so trying to advertise them as different challenges is taking the piss a little.</li><li>"70 CAREER RACES": Yes, there are seventy career races. It''s a shame they all suck.</li></ul><p>Having said all of those horribly harsh things, I may be being ever-so-slightly harsh - it''s not terrible, it''s just mind-numbingly average. The racing is entertaining for a couple of goes, but soon after you find you''ll stop paying much attention. The main problem I have is that it tries too hard to be a big game so it hasn''t focused on the details of making the driving any good. Which is a major flaw for a racing game. If you compare it to something like Burnout, which has a large game world that is still compact enough to find your way around, but actually has a damn good engine to back it up, you can see exactly where Codemasters have gone off the rails.</p><p>Now I''m off to Morrisons to buy some sausages for a massive fry up tonight - a much better use of my time.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', N'FUEL, an average racing game, gets the treatment from Declan Tyson.', N'fuel, game, ps3, gaming, size of fuel map, codemasters, micro machines, reviews, declan tyson', '20100804 17:18:09', '20131210 17:18:09', 1, 1)

I ended up buying an Advent 5.1 system for £35, which was one of the best bargains I''ve ever bought. However, when I got home and after taking 45 minutes to find space to plug everything in, I suddenly found myself swearing as when I played through the 5.1 version of Children of Bodom''s "Blooddrunk", it just came through as stereo - not even with bass.</p><p>Now, I was fully aware that my sound card <i>was</i> surround sound compatible, seeing as when I tested the output in the Windows Control panel, each one of the speakers worked perfectly.

Once this is downloaded and you have restarted your computer, you should have a new speaker symbol in your system tray, very similar to the volume control except red. Right-click on this and open up the Sound Manager. On the right hand side, change the speaker configuration to 5.1 (or 7.1 should you be so lucky) and test it to make sure all of your speakers are working correctly. Once this is done, check the box that says "Speaker Fill". This ensures that even stereo formats such as mp3 come out of all speakers in one way or another. If you like your music very bassy, you can swap your centre speaker and subwoofer around for a bit of extra kick (mp3 has nothing on the centre channel anyway so there''s nothing you''re missing out on by doing this).</p><p>It''s a relatively simple solution but quite hard to find, so I thought I''d share it with anyone else having this problem.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Tech and Design', N'A simple explanation of how to get surround sound working on a Realtek AC97 sound card.', N'surround sound, realtek, ac97, advent 5.1, sound card, tech support', '20100802 17:20:34', '20131210 17:20:34', 1, 1)

Since then, I must have watched it thousands of times. It truly was one of the best films of all time: it was funny for both adults and children alike, it taught morals and had a genuinely fantastic story and premise, and, as the first film to be completely done in CGI, was one of my major inspirations to go into Multimedia Design.</p><p>Then came 1999 and Toy Story 2, which suffered from sequel syndrome. It was still a fantastically witty film, but it wasn''t as well made and felt a lot more childish than the original, with jokes aimed at those born in 1995 rather than 1990. Having said that it had some brilliant moments, such as the fantastic Buzz Lightyear game that Rex plays in the opening sequence.</p><p>From here on out, this blog will contain spoilers about Toy Story 3. So if you haven''t seen it yet, I wouldn''t read on.</p><p>If I start as detached from the film as possible, Pixar have really outdone themselves with the animation. With each film they get better and better, and they put Dreamworks to shame time and time again. The attention to detail is immense, and the opening scene in particular where Andy''s fantasy is being shown to us (with the dialogue, brilliantly, being the same as Andy''s from the very first film - one of a few films that I know all the lines to) is absolutely fantastic. They have also started being more inventive with their camera angles, such as in the pre-school scene in which the toys are being thrown around, and the camera follows several different toys without cutting once, which must have taken several days to render. It''s good to be able to appreciate these things having experienced them first hand now - I feel it doesn''t ruin the magic, on the contrary, it merely heightens just how skilful and talented these people are.</p><p>Onto the story. Now, I don''t think anyone would go as far to say that Toy Story is "dark". But this truly is as dark as a children''s film could possibly get, and it makes you feel so sorry for every toy you threw out, put in the loft and forgot about, or simply left at home while you went to University. Woody, Buzz, Rex, Slinky and the rest of them go through hell. The previously mentioned pre-school scene is so hectic and the toys are almost being tortured (not as literally as Sid did to them in the first movie, but close enough) and at the end the pristine textures and models that Pixar worked so hard to create are destroyed. A personal heartbreak was when Rex''s tail came off. That''s not to mention the evil (but cute) teddy bear Lotso with the messed up past and the honestly quite creepy baby doll that acts as a bodyguard. And then there''s the furnace which genuinely has you on edge - you know everything''s going to be OK - but how? And it truly begins to bring a tear to even the baldest of a skinhead''s eye when Andy waves goodbye to his toys for the very last time.</p><p>By the end, all I could think was, why on Earth am I so emotionally attached? They''re toys, and not even my own toys. But that''s just the thing - they feel like my own toys. I''ve basically grown up with them - it was the first film I ever remember seeing, I owned most of the merchandise, and even today I can watch both Toy Story 1 and 2 and enjoy them both immensely. They have had a massive part in my upbringing and watching them nearly melt or be destroyed with seemingly no hope of safety felt like something inside of me was being taken away. There''s a sense of relief at the end, which is incredibly silly and perhaps as un-masculine as you can possibly get but I know for a fact that I''m not alone. In fact, if you didn''t feel moved in some way by that film, you''re dead inside. End of discussion.</p><p>Having said all of that, it''s still primarily a comedy - and it delivers on every possible level. The introduction of Ken was an obvious step, perhaps, but making him the ultimate metrosexual was a genius move. Everything he says is pure comedy gold. When Mr Potato Head becomes a tortilla is simply hilarious, and Buzz''s Spanish mode will never get old.</p><p>If I could think of one teeny-tiny problem, it would be that the only new characters who really make an impression are Lotso and Ken. There''s some rock thing that hits itself on the head to change its expression that''s just in for a laugh every now and then, but he could certainly be in it more, as could the purple octopus. Also, apparently the 3D isn''t very extensive, but I only saw it in 2D so I can''t pass judgement on that myself, and it wasn''t a huge issue for me anyway.</p><p>Other people have complained about the ending, saying that it''s too "boring", but I honestly don''t see any other way they could have ended it. The vast majority of people who would go to watch it would be veterans of the first two movies and therefore possibly moving to University just like Andy, and I think the entire film has been engineered more towards this audience than to children. It''s still definitely a child-friendly film, and children will find it just as funny and moving as we do, but for us, it''s closure. It''s a fitting end to a fantastic franchise, and if they were to make any more, they''d kill it. Yes, you could say there is potential for another sequel with Woody and the gang''s new home and new friends - but I think Pixar have more class than that, and they''ll restrain, just as they restrained from Woody talking to Andy (which I am so, so thankful for).</p><p>I haven''t seen Inception yet, but so far this is by far and away the best film of the year, from every possible angle. The only downside is that it has made me feel that my childhood has come to an end. However, even though I''m 20 next week, these films be close to my heart for many years to come.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'Toy Story 3 is a superb way to round off the greatest trilogy of kid''s films ever.', N'toy story 3, kids films, great films, nostalgia, woody, buzz lightyear, reviews', '20100725 17:24:28', '20131210 17:24:28', 1, 1)

For me, there is nothing better than a month of solid football, watching it every single day, filling out the wall chart, making predictions, watching the inevitable shocks and drama that come with England playing, the dirty Argentinians and ruthlessly efficient Germans. So how was the 2010 World Cup? Well, if I was to use one word, it would be ''strange''.</p><p>Right from the beginning there were shocks with the big teams. Literally all of the major competitors underperformed in the group stages aside from perhaps Argentina, including eventual champions Spain. Pre-competition I predicted a Brazil-Spain final with Spain having the edge, but I could never have predicted the manner in which Spain were to reach the final, not playing their normal standard of mesmerising football and scraping through every game 1-0, with Brazil crashing out in the quarter final to Holland.</p><p>There wasn''t even a spectacular overachiever as is usually standard to World Cups, with the closest probably being Uruguay, finishing 4th - but they were probably the strongest team in their group (with France being the most overrated team in the competition that don''t even deserve to be in the competition) and their progress was not all that shocking.</p><p>Referees were card happy from the very first games, with both yellow and red cards being shown as frequently as Emile Heskey cocks up, and none of the decisions were any good. Decisions that stuck out were the inexplicable sending off of Kaká, and Kingson, the clearly offside goal Argentina scored against Mexico, and the goal that never was in England''s 4-2 loss against Germany. That''s right, 4-2. We scored two goals that game.</p><p>And of course there were the underachieving players. Rooney, Messi, Torres, Van Persie, Luis Fabiano, Kaká, Ronaldo, the entire Italian team, Samuel Eto''o... the list goes on a long, long way.</p><p>Having said all that, there were some fantastic, thrilling moments. The 120th minute of the Ghana-Uruguay quarter-final where Luis Suarez handled the ball on the line and poor Asamoah Gyan - one of the breakthrough players of the tournament, in my opinion - rattled the crossbar and ultimately lost the game for the Africans, whom I feel immensely sorry for. Another penalty incident in the Spain vs Paraguay quarter-final where there were 2 penalties given within two minutes of eachother, both of which were saved. For drama, South Africa 2010 was certainly one of the more memorable cups, and hopefully it would have sparked some serious rethinking after the atrocious decisions made by some of the referees. Aside from Howard Webb, who refereed the final fantastically well, despite whatever the Dutch may say - maybe if they hadn''t played so dirtily they would have a case, but no - the only Englishman in the final did a fantastic job.</p><p>I''m still crossing my fingers for England to get the go ahead to host the 2018 World Cup, but I think it''s safe to say it depends a lot on the success of the 2012 Olympics which is a disaster in the making.</p><p>Either way, we now have to wait four whole years for the next dose of footballing heaven - the Euros will be in 2012 but they''ll certainly be overshadowed by the Olympics and they''re never as good anyway. In the meantime, I''m going to make use of the excellent movies coming out this summer, starting with Toy Story 3 tomorrow night. I suggest as many people go see it as possible, because it''s almost sure to be great. I''ll let you know sometime next week.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Fallout 3 is a modern take on these styles and incorporates elements from typical RPGs such as statistics and numbers but plays more like a First Person Shooter.</span><br></p><p>My friend Megasin1 compared this to a Banana. XIII is your standard banana, peeled and eaten from top to bottom, no frills, full of potassium and goodness. 3DDGH is a banana sprinkled on top of cornflakes - something a little bit different, but it works. Fallout, on the other hand, would be some mutant cross between a banana and an apple that for some bizarre reason is very tasty. Personally, I hate bananas, but I like the analogy.</p><p>As for the quality of the games themselves, they are all fantastic pieces of game engineering. XIII, while far from being the best Final Fantasy, includes a very good battle system that forces you to think constantly and runs very quickly and smoothly. As for the story, I felt that the setting and the backstory was a lot better than the story you play through the main game. It is also far, far too linear (which many critics have mentioned) - while Final Fantasy games are often fairly linear, XIII goes a step further in that there is only one route to take for the first 40 hours of the game. When the game does open up though, it gets a lot better, and the missions are challenging enough for you to feel the need to grind up some experience to tackle some of the tougher ones. The graphics are absolutely out of this world astonishing, and I could watch the cutscenes over and over and over and not get bored. Lifespan is typically epic, especially if you''re going to go for that all-elusive platinum trophy - you''re easily looking at 100 hours plus. The only gripe I have is with the experience system - it draws from the sphere grid but is a lot less confined and tries to give the illusion of customisation when really, there is basically none.</p><p>3D Dot Game Heroes is basically Zelda with an absolutely awesome artistic twist in that everything is made of giant pixels. The humour in the game is fantastic, and the puzzles and dungeons are actually better than most of the 2D Zelda games. It takes the piss out of typical Zelda storyline elements (the Master Sword, collecting various gems, all that stuff) but stay so close to the actual gameplay that you feel like you''re playing a new Zelda game. All the items are there - boomerang, hookshot, magic rod - and all work in the exact same way. Some may seem this as a rip-off, but it''s far from it - it''s the biggest tribute to A Link To The Past that there could possibly be. The world is large but not so big that you can''t find your way around, and there are plenty of little sub-events that are entertaining and take your attention away from the main story for a bit. There are also a ridiculous amount of swords, each more stupid than the last, and each customisable in multiple ways. Although the main game is not as long as XIII, there are many side-quests and tasks to perform (such as the pain that is the Bestiary) that make the game stretch out for still a long time. And then for those artists, the character editor will provide hours of fun making new characters, although the default characters are pretty awesome too, including a tank, a ninja, and Santa (!?).</p><p>And now we come to my favourite of the three - Fallout 3. I have always loved the Fallout games for their setting - a post-nuclear world where half of the inhabitants are mutants and the other half are evil, twisted bastards, and you always play as an unnamed protagonist that can either be a guy that saves the world by giving it clean water or (the more fun way) be an evil, twisted bastard. The Karma system is great, affecting several major things (for instance, if you''re evil, you will be hunted down for execution, and several instances in the main storyline) but also tiny little things in conversation that just make you laugh. It''s a simple system that gives a lot of satisfaction. The game world is absolutely massive. After a good 60 hours of playing, you probably still won''t have been to every part (even if you''ve completed every major quest). It plays like an FPS but it feels like an RPG, which I have decided is the best combination since someone put meat in bread. That''s what Fallout is - a massive sandwich of awesome. Whilst not as graphically stunning as XIII or as stylistic as 3DDGH, the scope of the game makes your jaw drop a little and the attention the detail is fantastic. And the best part of having a game world so big is the room for expansion, which Bethesda have pounced upon and I am very glad they have.</p><p>RPGs are awesome. But they''re moving forward, and I''m glad of this. Although XIII is not the best Final Fantasy it has an insane standard to stand up to and it is still a fantastic game, 3DDGH is better than the games it is tributing, and Fallout proves that genre borderlines can be crossed and should be more often.</p><p>Whilst I am on the topic, I just want to say that I am in love with Nintendo again - a new Zelda? Epic. New Golden Sun? Epic. A remake of GoldenEye, the best FPS that has yet to be surpassed? EPIC!</p>

A spiritual successor to the SNES&nbsp;</span><span>A Link To The Past</span><span>, it has the same main&nbsp;overworld&nbsp;and a similar dark/light world game mechanic. It has the nostalgia and&nbsp;</span><span>je ne sais quoi&nbsp;</span><span>magic of the older 2D Zelda games but with the brilliant storytelling and characterisation found in more recent games.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Graphically, it looks stunning: screenshots don''t do it justice at this resolution, but with the 3D on it''s probably one of the best looking games on the handheld, and it runs at a consistently high frame rate (which is more than can be said for something like Pokémon X and Y). &nbsp;The sounds are nostalgic, with much of the music recycled and/or remixed from&nbsp;</span><span>ALTTP.</span></p><p></p><p><span>There''s also a new weapon system which makes the game - in my opinion - a whole lot better. Traditionally, you traverse the dungeons, collecting new equipment in each one which allows you to solve puzzles in other dungeons or access new areas in the&nbsp;overworld. However, in&nbsp;</span><span>ALBW</span><span>, this is dumped in favour of a rabbit named&nbsp;Ravio&nbsp;who lives in your house rent-free and sells you stuff. Cheeky bastard, I know, but it means that all of the items are available from the start, and the game becomes much less linear and a lot more exploratory.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-50"><p>The storyline is great and although a little predictable is probably one of the best in the series: as per, some evil dude kidnaps Zelda and the seven sages of&nbsp;Hyrule&nbsp;in order to obtain the&nbsp;Triforce&nbsp;to revive&nbsp;Ganon, the king of Evil. All pretty standard so far. The evil dude (Yuga) hails from an exactly mirrored world to&nbsp;Hyrule&nbsp;called&nbsp;Lorule&nbsp;(HUR&nbsp;HUR&nbsp;HUR). He turns Link into a painting presumably drawn by an epileptic two-year old. Luckily,&nbsp;Ravio&nbsp;conveniently gave Link a bracelet that allows him to morph out of walls. Link manages to use this ability to slip in and out of&nbsp;Lorule.</p><p>Now here''s where it gets interesting, so if you want to avoid spoilers, turn back:&nbsp;Lorule''s&nbsp;princess Hilda says that there used to be a&nbsp;Triforce&nbsp;in place in&nbsp;Lorule&nbsp;that differed to the&nbsp;Triforce&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hyrule. It&nbsp;was destroyed, sending the kingdom into disarray and despair. After a few twists and turns it turns out that she''s in on Yuga''s plan to steal the&nbsp;Triforce&nbsp;- but only so she can revive&nbsp;Lorule. In what I found to be an unexpected twist, the saviour of the day is&nbsp;Ravio, who it turns out is&nbsp;Lorule''s&nbsp;mirror image of Link. More stuff happens,&nbsp;Hyrule&nbsp;is saved,&nbsp;yadayadayada&nbsp;the end.</p><p></p>

It''s a simple way to share screenshots and silly gaming drawings with the community and there''s some pretty neat stuff on there. But one can''t help but be a little disappointed by the lack of features. Now Nintendo are moving closer to a joint account system (at long last), it may improve in the future but it''s slow work.</p><p>One thing to make the screenshot sharing infinitely better would be to include some kind of ''share'' button on the hardware that takes a screenshot, pauses the game and prompts you for your note, and then does the actual processing in the background while you play on, because right now you have to sleep your game, connect to&nbsp;Miiverse, post your update, wait for it post and then exit&nbsp;Miiverse&nbsp;and return to your game. It''s an unnecessarily complicated process that could be solved pretty easily.</p><p>I used&nbsp;Miiverse&nbsp;to get screenshots of the final stages of&nbsp;ALBW&nbsp;to put up here. I did get a slap on the wrist for accidentally forgetting to mark the fact that&nbsp;Ganon&nbsp;is&nbsp;in the game as a spoiler, but hey, who cares.

That''s not to say that there weren''t good games. Indeed, there were some of the best games of this generation.&nbsp;</p><p>Amongst the usual annual drivel of dull engine clones, there were some excellent standouts.&nbsp;<i>Papers, Please</i>&nbsp;is an absolutely brilliant, story-driven game in which you play a border control agent for a post-soviet&nbsp;-stancountry, torn apart by terrorists from other&nbsp;-stan&nbsp;countries. You struggle to live day by day, using your measly&nbsp;paycheck&nbsp;to keep your family warm and fed, but that''s about it. It''s full of humour, sadness and the gameplay, although simple, is surprisingly addictive and unforgiving.</p><p>Another special mention goes to&nbsp;<i>Bioshock&nbsp;Infinite</i>.&nbsp;It''s not particularly&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;in terms of gameplay but it gets what it does exactly right, and it breaks the trend of boring grey-brown-and-blue-if-it''s-in-space palettes of normal shooters with a bright, vivid presentation and the best storyline of a game in many a year.</p><p>However, there can only be one winner. The vast majority of gaming institutions opted for one of two games as their Game of the Year; and as I have not played <i>GTA5</i>, I have no choice but to bestow this honour to&nbsp;<b><i>The Last of Us</i></b>.&nbsp;There''s so much to say about this game that can''t be adequately summed up in a few sentences. Using a very similar engine to the&nbsp;<i>Uncharted</i>&nbsp;series, but dramatically reduced in pace (and ammunition), it is survival horror dressed up to look like an action game. The storyline and performances are gripping with themes of morality and loyalty at its core. The ending is spine-tingling. The multiplayer is out of this world. It''s truly deserving of this accolade and all the others that it will receive.</p><p></p>

There were few standout movies, and two of my favourites - <i>Django&nbsp;Unchained</i>&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;Wreck-it Ralph</i>&nbsp;- are listed on Wikipedia as 2012 movies due to their American release dates. Not that it really makes a difference to me.</p><p>Even skimming down the list of blockbusters there''s little to celebrate.&nbsp;<i>Iron Man 3</i>&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;Thor 2&nbsp;</i>were both entertaining but hardly anything special. There are a couple of decent kid''s films -&nbsp;<i>Despicable Me 2&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Monsters University</i>, notably - but again, they''re not exactly classics. Then, of course, there was the absolutely appalling mess that was&nbsp;<i>Man of Steel</i>&nbsp;- genuinely one of the worst films I''ve ever seen (only slightly better than&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City 2</i>).</p><p>That leaves a handful of good-but-not-great movies as my only realistic nominees for the best film of the year. Furthermore, I''ve only a handful of those, so&nbsp;<b><i>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</i></b>&nbsp;is my best film of 2013 by default. That''s not to discredit it, mind you: I enjoyed it even more than<i>&nbsp;An Unexpected Journey</i>,&nbsp;which in turn I enjoyed more than&nbsp;<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;trilogy. That may be a slightly controversial opinion, but I personally believe that the more light-hearted approach suits this trilogy better than the full on grit of the other films. It''s certainly shaping up to be a much better prequel trilogy than&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>.</p><p></p>

There''s the final installation in the&nbsp;<i>Hobbit</i>&nbsp;trilogy and a long-overdue sequel to&nbsp;<i>Sin City</i>.</p><p>There is of course, the fourth series of&nbsp;<i>Game of Thrones</i>&nbsp;and another series to the fantastic<i>&nbsp;House of Cards</i>, although I know for certain that my television will spend most of the year showing me Brazil and the<i> FIFA World Cup</i>.</p><p>The world of gaming, too, is looking promising: Sony''s recently announced&nbsp;<i>PlayStation Now</i>&nbsp;service that allows you to stream PS3 (and eventually PS2 and PS4 games) to devices such as tablets and smartphones is a bold company move that is highly beneficial for the gaming community - and is seriously pushing to me to consider buying a PS Vita in the summer. Also mentioned in last year''s DEC Awards was&nbsp;<i>Metal Gear Solid V</i>, which has since been delayed and split into two separate titles, and hopefully should be coming our way this year. Whispers of a&nbsp;<i>Majora''s&nbsp;Mask</i>&nbsp;remake for 3DS titillate me, too.</p><p>My biggest anticipation is the sequel to what is (one of) my&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;series of all times - you guessed it, it''s&nbsp;<i><b>Super Smash Bros</b></i>. for Wii U and 3DS.&nbsp;I do hope that Sakurai improves the name slightly before release (just SSB4 would be fine) but even if it is a retarded name, that''s not going to stop me loving every second of it.</p><p></p>

To make a change from the usual wall of text, I''m going to actually order these three titles with a&nbsp; brief explanation to why they are where they are:</p><ol><li value="3"><p><i>Pokémon X and Y&nbsp;</i>- the latest versions finally bring full 3D battles and they are bloody beautiful. It''s also got one of the best&nbsp;overworlds&nbsp;and despite a rather fluffy storyline is engaging and entertaining throughout. Criticisms leveled at the frequent drops in frame rate and lack of new Pokémon are justified, in addition to Nintendo''s poor handling of it''s promised service&nbsp;Pokémon Bank, but it feels like the most ''complete'' experience yet, and hopefully when they inevitably bring out&nbsp;Pokémon Z&nbsp;these issues will be corrected.</p></li><li value="2"><p><i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</i>&nbsp;- this is the first original Zelda title for the 3DS and it''s probably the best 2D Zelda to date. It''s game mechanics are ever-so-slightly different to your typical Zelda game - for example, you don''t get any of your items in dungeons, but rather can pick and choose from the very start of the game from a selection of all the items - and it avoids the linearity that occasionally pervades other games in the series. Fantastic game.</p></li><li value="1"><p><i><b>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</b></i>&nbsp;- the winner is a game where you look after a bunch of whiny animals in a run-down town in the middle of nowhere. It''s surprisingly one of the deepest, most well thought-out games I''ve ever played - it''s cute, and you can spend hundreds upon thousands of hours making your town just&nbsp;so perfect.&nbsp;What''s incredible is the genuine friendship you feel for these characters - you feel sad when they leave, happy when they send you their picture, and laugh when they fall in a pitfall. It just keeps bringing me back, day after day, season after season -&nbsp;New Leaf&nbsp;is amazing.</p></li></ol>

Nevertheless, it''s here to stay, so rather than complain I''ll just deal with it and say that the single best ''App'' across all platforms is the absolutely astonishing&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/citymapper-london-public-transport/id469463298">CityMapper.</a></p><p>I must concede for those outside London, New York or Paris it''s ultimately useless - but for those of us within these&nbsp;metropoles, it''s by far and away the most useful piece of software invented. In London, I can check when my bus is coming, see if there''s a quicker route, judge whether or not to walk somewhere, or even see how many Boris bikes are available near me and then whether or not there''s any stands free to return the bike at my destination.</p><p>All the credit can''t just go to&nbsp;CityMapper''s&nbsp;developers, though - it has to be said that&nbsp;TfL''s&nbsp;openness and willingness to provide developers with an API for all of this data is a very generous move that many travel agencies would keep themselves.

After watching Sex and the City 2, I don''t want to keep that policy intact anymore.</p><p>With the first film, although it was not to my taste, I could see why a certain audience segment would like it: it had an easy to follow storyline with enough dramatic twists and turns to make it last the 2 and a half hours, and each character had their own clearly defined sub-story with some successful attempts at light humour throughout.</p><p>The second, however, I struggle to see how anyone can enjoy it at all. Let''s start with the acting. Peter Griffin once said "They let Sarah Jessica Parker''s face on TV and she looks like a foot". You''d get much better acting out of a foot. The other three aren''t much better, either. And all of the characters are so incredibly dislikeable - Carrie is annoying, selfish and whiny, Samantha is a 50-year old slut, and the ginger one winds me up just looking at her. I can''t even remember the name of the last one, because she plays such a minor role, but she''s ridiculously uptight about everything. Their husbands aren''t much better either. "Big" is a typical lazy slob and the total opposite to Carrie, which makes you wonder why the hell they''re together in the first place, the ginger one''s husband is just a weird geek and cheated on his wife in the last film, and the Jewish guy has perhaps two lines in the whole film - but at least this means there''s no reason to hate him.</p><p>Moving on to the story. Or therelackof. For the first hour of the film, nothing really happens. There''s some girl with an atrocious Irish accent who doesn''t wear a bra. Highlight of the film. Carrie and Big have an argument. Nothing happens for a while. Then suddenly, Samantha''s been invited by a strange man to go to the United Arab Emirates! Of course, without any suspicions, the girls head off to the least sex-friendly culture in the whole world with the biggest slut in the whole world. Then again, for ages, nothing happens. There are a few points of drama but they are resolved in literally a matter of seconds and are incredibly predictable and dull. Then they are on the run because Samantha tries to have sex in public and they are rescued by some Arab women who, underneath their burqas, wear the same retarded fashion sense as the women from New York.</p><p>Then nothing happens and the film ends.</p><p>I was genuinely annoyed by the end of this film. It was so bad that the four chavs in front who didn''t shut up almost enhanced the experience. If you''re looking for a chick flick, watch a British film from Working Title - at least they don''t make you want to eat your own eyeballs, shit them out and then stomp on them.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'the worst films ever, sex and the city 2, cinema, shit', N'the worst films ever, sex and the city 2, cinema, shit', '20100614 17:07:31', '20140206 17:07:31', 1, 1)

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>WARNING - THIS BLOG CONTAINS SPOILERS</b></h2><p>The rollercoaster thrill ride that has graced our screens for nine years is finally over. For those of you not aware, 24 is an American TV show in the "thriller" genre, with each season following the day in the extraordinary life of Counter-Terrorist Unit agent Jack Bauer and his family and coworkers. The episodes take place in real time, with 24 hour-long episodes making up each season, and the nature of the show is to try and make the most dramatic situations seem real and believable, using simple media tricks such as a handheld camera and natural lighting.</p><p>For those of you who are aware, ZOMG JACK BAUER.</p><p>It is difficult to decide where I stand on the finale. I enjoyed it immensely, and it was a fantastic, edge-of-your-seat watch, with Jack and Chloe''s immense showdown, and the brilliant idea to use the iconic ticking clock counting down to zero instead of to the hour was potent. However, I have said for years that for 24 to have a satisfying ending, Jack Bauer must die an incredibly heroic and fitting death, and none of that happened. Instead, Jack flees the country - which would be a fair ending, but it''s already happened before. It didn''t feel like the end of 24 forever. It felt like the end of another standard season. Which was disappointing, to say the least.</p><p>The 24 movie is being penned, and whilst I am looking forward to watching that, I was quite hoping it would be a prequel to Bauer''s life at CTU so we could learn a bit more about his seemingly never-ending past. Of course this is still possible but all logic points to a continuation of Jack''s return after a few more years of hiding because his daughter Kim will probably do something stupid and get herself kidnapped.</p><p>Of course, the most disappointing thing of all is that there will be no more 24 to watch (and if they make more, in all honesty, I''ll be a little annoyed they didn''t save the dramatic countdown until later). There was also the final episode of LOST, but I don''t care about that.</p><p>However, something I was vaguely interested in was the finale of the first season (in fact, probably ever, due to poor viewing figures) of FlashForward. It was a vaguely entertaining show with some good ideas but there are hundreds of loose threads all over the place and the finale, clearly expecting another season to be scheduled, did absolutely nothing to tie up most of these.</p><p>The premise of FlashForward is that everyone on Earth blacks out for two minutes and seventeen seconds and then witnesses two minutes and seventeen seconds of the future of April 29th, 2010. This is a great premise for a show, and there are many interesting themes about changing the way the future pans out. Some people''s flashforwards come true, others do not - which is a fair way to end the season. However there is no straightforward explanation as to why it happened, there are only several theories provided by several different parties, and most annoyingly of all, perhaps, is that at the end of the episode, another blackout occurs, with people witnessing another flashforward. It''s just a giant middle finger to the audience, in my opinion. If another series had been commissioned, it would have been a good ending (although somewhat predictable) but with the series'' future uncertain, I feel like I''ve wasted many hours of my life.</p><p>Anyway, that''s most of the TV over for this year, although a new series of The IT Crowd is due to premiere on 24th June (not to mention the World Cup starting on the 12th) but it''s certainly been an enjoyable ride.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'A synopsis of the finales of two decent television series.', N'24, flashforward, tv finales, good telly, addictive, jack bauer', '20100602 17:11:19', '20140206 17:11:19', 1, 1)

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p>Let me start by saying that I was a massive fan of Bullet For My Valentine''s first album, The Poison. They were the first band I went to see live and they were absolutely fantastic. Matt Tuck had a fantastic swagger about him that was both arrogant but somewhat likeable, and they had massive anthems such as 4 Words (To Choke Upon) that were truly fantastic.</p><p>And then there was Scream Aim Fire. Oh dear. This album almost destroyed what I thought of them, and the only thing that was going to draw me back to their third album was the fact that the reason SAF was so appalling was that Tuck had contracted laryngitis and therefore could not sing properly anymore.</p><p>The first track I heard off of Fever was Begging For Mercy, and I was afraid that maybe Bullet were destined to just become a shit band that happened to have one good album. Then one day, a friend told me about another song he had heard on Radio One called Your Betrayal - and told me that it was more like the Bullet of old - and, thank god, he was right.</p><p>And so I waited with mixed feelings for the release of Fever.</p><p>The first three tracks (Your Betrayal, Fever, and The Last Fight) are big, bold, and brilliant. Then it progresses into the more ballad-style A Place Where You Belong, akin to an earlier single All These Things I Hate, only not as good. The album then blasts back with Pleasure and Pain, and while it still has the typical angsty-emo style lyrics (e.g.&nbsp;<i>"Embrace your apathy/You don''t bring me pleasure/You just bring me pain"</i>) it has ripping, heavy riffs and a decent solo.</p><p>Then Alone comes in. This riff sounds like it''s inspired by As I Lay Dying''s Forsaken, only it''s got melodic lyrics instead of Tim Lambesis'' growling vocals - and although they can''t quite touch the lords of Metalcore, it does a damn good job. It''s even got a very good solo. This song is definitely the highlight of the album.</p><p>Breaking Out, Breaking Down is average - it''s not bad, but it''s not the most interesting of songs to listen to. Then Bittersweet Memories sounds like some kind of mainstream pop with metal elements - not to my taste, and it sounds the same most of the way through. Dignity is better, and wouldn''t sound out of place on The Poison or the Hand of Blood EP.</p><p>Begging For Mercy flashes past in a blaze of mediocrity before the album''s outro, Pretty On The Outside begins. This is a fitting end to the album, it''s heavy, atmospheric and catchy, definitely ending the album on one of the better songs, and makes you feel very glad you listened to it (although I must say, it ends rather abruptly).</p><p>This album is a difficult one to review, as it has some very good highs, but then it''s plagued by songs that sound like filler material. It''s a massive, massive, massive leap from Scream Aim Fire, and the songs that are good are better than anything from The Poison.</p><p>In one way I look at it, I''m disappointed. But in another way, I think I''m being too picky. I mean, seven out of eleven songs are fantastic. And at the end of the day, they''re the musicians, not me -</p><p>And Look At Them Now.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Music', N'Declan Tyson reviews Bullet For My Valentine: The Fever', N'declan tyson, bullet for my valentine, fever, review, the poison, matt tuck, 4 words to choke upon', '20100426 17:14:46', '20140206 17:14:46', 1, 1)

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p></p><p>I&nbsp;know it''s been a while since I posted a blog, but I''ve recently had a lot of work to do regarding 3D modelling and documentary editing. All university work is over now, though, so I decided to rent the critically acclaimed "Heavy Rain" - essentially an interactive film filled with QTEs.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, QTE are "Quick Time Events" - normally portions of a game that require detailed cinematography rather than the standard animation uses these to give a sense of interaction, basically telling you to press square/circle/A/B or whatever at the right time, if you do, your character will manage to hit the opponent, but if you fail, your character gets shot, for example.</p><p>Now most of the time, QTEs are used by game designers being too lazy to include a more interactive combat system, but Heavy Rain manages to make it seem like less of a rip-off and more of an experience. That being said, charging £40 for a film that you can press buttons in IS a rip off.</p><p>However, this game is well worth a rent. Gameplay wise it''s fairly limited, but the story is compelling (although there are several issues I take with the consistency of it) and the multiple endings will make you want to play it through several times more. Graphically, it ranges from average to very good - the textures are absolutely fantastic and the environment incredibly detailed. However in some scenes the character models look slightly blocky, but most of the time the absolutely superb lighting effects manage to disguise this. Somewhat strangely, the rain effect often looks fake - which is a massive oversight seeing as it is raining for 95% of the game.</p><p>The soundtrack is not so good, however. The voice acting is average at best, and the background music often doesn''t fit the situation and there seem to be 4 different tracks repeated for the entire 7 or 8 hours which gets VERY grating, especially on re-playthroughs. The lifespan is limited to obtaining all the endings, and I managed to obtain the platinum trophy within the week I rented it with not too much effort.</p><p>To sum up, just don''t buy it. Worth a rent definitely, and maybe if you can pick up a cheap copy somewhere, but you won''t get a full priced game out of it.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', N'Declan Tyson reviews Heavy Rain, one of the PS3&#39;s many cinematic-driven exclusives.', N'heavy rain, ps3, gaming, quick time events, qtes, cinematics, story, dark, mystery, reviews', '20100412 17:17:46', '20140206 17:17:46', 1, 1)

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p><span>At its core, there is a cracking little game waiting to come out of Dungeon Keeper''s latest&nbsp;iOS&nbsp;and Android reboot. The elements that made the original&nbsp;games so&nbsp;great are still there, as is the sense of&nbsp;humour, and the addition of raids on other players is a welcome and entertaining one. But it has some deep-seated issues which represent a wider problem in the industry as a whole right now.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let me start by saying that I am not 100% against the free to play model, as most other reviewers are. It is a legitimate, if slightly immoral way to make money&nbsp;and 95% of&nbsp;the games available are fully playable without ever spending a penny.</span></p><p></p><p><span>To understand why, one needs to&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;that these games - and indeed the entire mobile platform - are not designed for the hardcore gamer, and as such a different approach must be made both economically and in gameplay. The casual market isn''t looking for games</span><span>&nbsp;to be played for hours upon hours at a time - they''re tube games, bus games, games for when your girlfriend is trying on a new dress, for when your boyfriend is watching the football game. As such the games impose restrictions on your actions to make sure that the gamers come back.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Think about it this way: you''re sitting at the train station waiting to go to work. You whip out your phone, and start to play&nbsp;</span><span>The Sims</span><span>. You tell your&nbsp;Sim&nbsp;to go to work. In the traditional model, you could speed through this and perform the next action within a few seconds. Then your train arrives. You get on the train and immediately forget about it, potentially never playing the game again. With the F2P model, your&nbsp;Sim&nbsp;going to work would take the same time as it would yourself going to work, so as you wait for the train to take you back, you get a notification prompting you to play again. This is what the model relies on: short bursts of gameplay every few hours.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Here''s where the model gets messy. If you''re really&nbsp;impatient you can pay to continue, and traditional gamers are anything but patient. A gamer would want to&nbsp;continue to play on the train, whereas a casual would forget about it - and so we''ve got the gamer trapped. If they want to play, they have to pay. Further</span><span>&nbsp;problems arise when you have some kind of multiplayer element - it can easily turn into a pay-to-win contest.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p>However, Dungeon Keeper is&nbsp;<b>no more problematic</b>&nbsp;in this sense than any other F2P game, and yet it has come under much more criticism than others like&nbsp;The Sims&nbsp;Freeplay&nbsp;or&nbsp;Clash of Clans. Why?</p><p></p><p><span>It''s fairly simple and, in a way, justified - the Dungeon Keeper IP and gameplay are not suited to the&nbsp;freeplay&nbsp;model, or the casual market. It''s a strategy game that requires extensive planning and having to wait up to 5 hours to build one room is far from ideal. It''s also an IP that gamers (including myself) have been screaming out for a sequel for since the turn of the century, a game that they''re expecting to sink hundreds of hours into - but in order to do that they''d have to spend hundreds of real-life pounds. In short, there''s no value to be had for a hardcore gamer for a game that they feel is their right.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It''s a shame because this will tarnish the name of one of gaming history''s best-loved franchises, and it further shows that the dissolution of Bullfrog by EA will be one of gaming''s greatest tragedies. What could have been the best game of all time has been reduced to a similar level to&nbsp;</span><span>Candy Crush Saga</span><span>.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', NULL, NULL, '20140207 11:20:16', '20140207 11:20:16', 1, 1)

This is indeed the third film in a row where he has done so: The Wolf of Wall Street sees Leo reunited with favored director Scorsese after a brief stint with the slightly more alternative choices of&nbsp;BazLurhman''s&nbsp;Great Gatsby (whom he previously worked with in&nbsp;</span><span>Romeo+Juliet)&nbsp;</span><span>and Tarantino''s&nbsp;Django&nbsp;Unchained.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Jordan Belfort is slightly different from Jay Gatsby and Calvin&nbsp;Candie&nbsp;in that he is also a true-to-life, non-fictional human being. This is the incredible true story of an asshole stockbroker who lets nothing and no-one stop him from doing what he wants to do - which inevitably is to become a bigger asshole day by day.</span></p><p></p><p><span>&nbsp;There is literally no reason to like Jordan Belfort. He embezzles, cheats on his wife, earns more money than is fair and refuses to&nbsp; share any of it, and by all accounts should have died of either HIV or a coke OD before the first half of the film is up: but&nbsp;</span><span>Scorsese manages to take the lowest scum imaginable and - together with&nbsp;DiCaprio''s&nbsp;irrepressible smug charm - manages to turn him into one of the best anti-heroes of the modern age.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It helps that in the first thirty minutes or so he''s a pretty genuine guy. He goes into stocks to make money for him and his fiancée, isn''t afraid to try and get a job he considers beneath him, and winces when he''s referred to as "The Wolf of Wall Street", feeling it portrays him in a negative light. It''s not until he meets Donnie&nbsp;Azoff&nbsp;that he starts embracing this newfound persona - he has his first joint, tag-teaming the secretary and defrauds people using penny stocks - all largely from the influence of Jonah Hill''s character.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It is unarguably Hill''s best ever performance, largely coming from the fact that this is the first role with an ounce of sincerity to it - and it''s not a particularly serious film. In fact, the entire film revels in excess to the point of absurdity. It''s been both praised and&nbsp;criticised&nbsp;for this: some saying it''s drugs and nudity for the sake of drugs and nudity, with another camp saying that this was what life was actually like for stockbrokers in the 80s (and indeed is still so for many today). I went in expecting a lot of drugs and nudity, and I saw even more than I was expecting. It&nbsp;</span><span>is&nbsp;</span><span>excessive, and at points probably is just for the sake of it, but it never really feels like it - it feels oddly necessary.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Which brings me on to the performance of lead actress Margot Robbie. If you can get past her extremely poor accent (an Ozzie trying to be American and turning out to be sort of Dutch) she puts in a fantastic performance that will probably catapult her into superstardom. This will no doubt be helped by the fact that she is involved in gratuitous full-frontal nudity and explicit masturbation scenes that make&nbsp;</span><span>Basic Instinct&nbsp;</span><span>look like a children''s film - I guess it''s one way to make a name for yourself in the industry.</span></p><p></p><p>This is already a prospect for best film of the year, and out of all of the Oscar-noms&nbsp;this time round it''s one that stands out from the typically pompous faux-artistic drivel and actually feels like a film rather than someone''s showcase of racial guilt or complete misery that seems to guarantee an award.<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Wolf of Wall Street </i>is&nbsp;Scorsese at his absolute best - and that''s saying a hell of a lot.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his absolute best - and that''s saying a hell of a lot.', N'wolf of wall street, leonardo dicaprio, jonah hill, margot robbie, full frontal nudity in cinema', '20140214 14:43:27', '20140214 14:43:27', 1, 1)

We''re now on version&nbsp;<b>4.0</b>. It''s been 16 months since 3.0 was released, just like the 16 months that preceded that version, and once again it''s time to shake things up with the new skills that I''ve learnt working at Howoco.</p><p>What''s new? Well, a lot of that should be immediately obvious - the new User Interface ditches 3.x''s magazine design and adopts a cleaner, smoother, responsive template. However, what''s not immediately obvious is what''s going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;<b>MYNX</b>&nbsp;has undergone another update, this time a severe one to make it into a proper Content Management System with the mantra of being&nbsp;<b>flexible, lightweight and responsive</b>. Although not quite ready for release you can follow the progress on the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/declantyson/mynx">GitHub repository</a>&nbsp;for the ASP/C# version (PHP port is yet to be begun).&nbsp;</p><p>Why the changes? In addition to a bit of nice consistency with the timings, I was never truly happy with 3.0 - it always felt to me a little cluttered and unrefined. I''ve also developed a lot since 2012, both technically and creatively thanks to working with some of the best designers in the industry, and although I''m not even close to their level, why shouldn''t I show off my new found abilities?</p><p>There are subtractions as well as additions; most notably the comment system. This will come back as&nbsp;<b>MYNX&nbsp;</b>evolves, but I made a concious decision to release without comments as 90% of the previous website''s comments were spam. Also, moving away from the magazine style meant removing certain gimmicky features like the carousel and related blogs (again, these may return as&nbsp;<b>MYNX&nbsp;</b>plugins but probably not on this site).</p><p>The restructuring of the&nbsp;<b>MYNX&nbsp;</b>database means that the previous versions&nbsp;<b>will no longer be updated&nbsp;</b>- this is (probably) the last time this will happen, and if you want to view the old websites you can view them here:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://2012.declantyson.net/">v3</a>&nbsp;- last content 14th February 2014<br><a href="http://2011.declantyson.net">v2</a> - last content 14th February 2014<br><a href="http://2010.declantyson.net">v1</a> - last content 10th March 2011<br></p></blockquote><p>To the future!</p>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p><span>I''ve spent most of my life being pretty staunchly anti-Apple, for the reason most other anti-Apple people are: they produce overpriced, form-over-function machines that rarely live up to the expectations that the £1000+ price tag sets for them. I thought OS X was an abomination and it took them 4 iterations of iPhone to get it even remotely close to an acceptable level for the modern market.</span></p><p></p><p><span>My opinion of the iPhone has become somewhat more favorable since I purchased one in 2012. They are incredibly simple and efficient - even if the build quality is far worse than it''s made out to be (I am on my fourth handset in less than two years) and I''m seriously considering getting another one for my next, which would have been unthinkable four years ago. However, OS X has continued to be source of anger every time I come into contact with it, which - I will admit - has been limited.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Cue a turning point in my relationship with Macintosh when I was handed a&nbsp;Macbook&nbsp;Air and tasked with creating OS X applications. They''ve run out of cats and the latest version of the operating system is nicknamed ''Mavericks''. With this in mind my two months of Mac development begins.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I will say this - the build of the&nbsp;Macbook&nbsp;Air is absolutely&nbsp;</span><span>phenomenal.</span><span>&nbsp;It''s incredibly slim and light and yet feels very sturdy. The processor is practically silent, even when under stress, and it doesn''t ever feel like it''s overheating. The&nbsp;trackpad&nbsp;is of a very high quality, and t</span><span>he keyboard is incredibly quick and comfortable to type on.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>HOWEVER. Here comes problem number one. There''s no getting used to the stupid layout, the command button is in the most inconvenient fucking place if you''ve got hands that are larger than an ant and I keep putting the damn thing to sleep when I miss the backspace key. Also, we don''t all live in America, Apple - it''s called fucking&nbsp;localisation. Even the installation programs have the American flag to&nbsp;symbolise&nbsp;English. Disgusting.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I ended up plugging in a USB keyboard which allowed my sausage fingers a little more room to maneuver which partially solved the problem, and also got rid of the sleeping problem. It meant that the&nbsp;trackpad&nbsp;became a little more uncomfortable to use, and the Apple&nbsp;mouses&nbsp;are just awful in every possible sense, but that''s OK - I can just use any standard USB mouse.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Then I set it up to use a monitor, and essentially used the&nbsp;Macbook&nbsp;as a tower.</span></p><p></p><p><span>HOWEVER. Here comes problem number 2. Proprietary bullshit strikes again as the display output is a ''Thunderbolt'' cable. There is enough room on the side of the laptop to install something normal like DVI or VGA. Even HDMI. But instead I have to give them yet more money. Because only Apple sell these Thunderbolt cables. Of course.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Fine, whatever. Done. Now it''s time to actually do some programming!</span></p><p></p><p><span>This is where I was genuinely impressed the most -&nbsp;XCode&nbsp;is a very intuitive development environment that runs smoothly with an autocomplete system similar to Visual Studio''s&nbsp;Intellisense&nbsp;except it''s probably a little bit more responsive. Build times are quick and you can do everything you''d want to reasonably easy.&nbsp;</span><span>The debugging tools are also very good, making it easy to spot when your application is running memory leaks and taking up too much processing power.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Moving onto the programming language itself, Objective-C is mostly fairly straightforward but has various quirks that irritate. Every view has to be drawn individually, which is fine, but it bugs me slightly that the co-ordinates are drawn from the bottom left, rather than the top left as logic would dictate. And the documentation is vague and often difficult to navigate. They''re extensive, sure, and given enough time you can find what you want, but it''s nowhere near as helpful as Microsoft''s documentation on C# (side note: considering how often programmers need to use the hash symbol it''s well hidden on a Mac). If you know the name of the function you''re looking for, then you''ll be absolutely fine, but if you don''t, you may have a hard time.</span></p><p></p><p><span>This is made significantly worse by the community of Objective-C programmers; many seem to be pretentious and&nbsp;patronising, too often responding to legitimate&nbsp;StackOverflow&nbsp;questions with something along the lines of ''read Apple''s documentation n00b, Apple has great information on this you clearly haven''t looked for this obscure function that I know but refuse to tell you about LOL''. Of course, this doesn’t apply to all of them: many will provide links to the correct section and the function you''re asking about with politeness and decorum. It''s a shame but it adds to my confirmation bias of Apple''s user base.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>So, taking all of this into consideration, has my opinion of OS X changed? Well, yes, it''s improved slightly. I still dislike it, but I don’t hold such vitriol for it anymore. I still can''t see why anyone would choose it over a Windows or Linux system but to each their own, I suppose.</span></p><p></p><p><span>My first Mac app is closed-doors to a select group of people at BT, I''m afraid, but I will use what I''ve learnt to create another one. At some point. Maybe.</span></p>

All of the new characters have been kept under wraps extremely well (aside from possibly&nbsp;Palutena&nbsp;- see later) and the reveal movies for new fighters have been unexpected and of a very high quality.</span><br></p><p></p><p><span>But nothing compared to last night when we got the most complete view of the game yet. And now I''m having a hype attack.</span></p><p></p><p><span><b>Release Dates</b></span></p><p></p><p><span>The news that the 3DS version is out in the summer suits me just fine - I currently don''t own a Wii U and the fact that it''s going to be a holiday release for the Wii U is probably a smart decision, trying to shift the console in time for Christmas (and Thanksgiving? I think the Yanks give out presents then). In fact, the whole stream was largely geared towards the 3DS version, as I''ll touch on.</span></p><p></p><p><span><b>Fast as Fuck</b></span></p><p></p><p><span>An impressive point mentioned early on that seems to be have been largely overlooked is the fact that the 3DS version will run at 60FPS, even on 3D. This is huge news, especially when you take into account how good it looks and the fact that Pokémon X and Y could barely scrape 30 at points. Limiting assist trophies to a lower frame rate is a good idea, and it looks as if it has worked.</span></p><p></p><p><span>In addition to this, the combat itself seems to have massively increased in pace - and as we will see at several points in the Direct, Sakurai is clearly listening to his&nbsp;fanbase&nbsp;that Brawl was too slow.</span></p><p></p>
</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-50"><p></p><p><b>Troll Level: Sakurai</b></p><p>Over the past few months there has been much discussion of the potential new and returning characters to the series. There''s been a pretty convincing leak of&nbsp;Palutena, the goddess from the Kid Icarus series of games, as a playable character. There has been much talk of&nbsp;Mewtwo''s&nbsp;return due to his reappearance in&nbsp;Pokemon&nbsp;X and Y. Everybody wants Ridley in the game because he''s a fucking badass space pirate. There''s even been some doubt over returning characters, because of altered&nbsp;movesets&nbsp;for&nbsp;Samus&nbsp;and Sheik.</p><p>Sakurai addressed all of these characters in the most devilish way he could. After introducing Yellow Devil, who would not be playable but merely a boss character on the Mega Man stage, he teased Ridley''s shadow saying ''other boss characters will appear''. Many people have already said ''RIDLEY DECONFIRMED!!'' whilst others are saying ''WHAT ARE YOU STUPID HE''S CLEARLY BUILDING HYPE''. Me? I certainly don''t think he''s&nbsp;deconfirmed, but I won''t be holding my breath for him to be playable.</p><p>Then he confirmed that characters who had alternate forms - such as Zelda and&nbsp;Samus&nbsp;- would not have their alternate forms anymore, and saying that Zero Suit&nbsp;Samus&nbsp;would not be returning... before pulling a complete 180 and letting everyone breathe a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</p><p>He dotted ''Trophy Quizzes'' throughout the direct, showing trophies of Nintendo characters that would not be in the game as playable characters. One of them was clearly&nbsp;Palutena&nbsp;from behind... except when the camera rotated, it was in fact Pseudo-Palutena, a zombie version of&nbsp;Palutena&nbsp;from Kid Icarus: Uprising. If anything, this pretty much confirms the leak - I am almost 100% sure&nbsp;Palutena&nbsp;is going to be a playable character.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most&nbsp;trollworthy&nbsp;of all, was the reveal of&nbsp;Greninja, which almost nobody predicted and literally nobody expected. He saved it for the very end of the direct, long after the ''New Characters'' section, and from the shadows it looked like&nbsp;Mewtwo. There must have been some kind of deliberate planning to choose a Pokémon with a similar build and even the same weird hands when every Smasher is clamouring for&nbsp;Mewtwo''s&nbsp;return. Unfortunately, as awesome as&nbsp;Greninja&nbsp;looks, unless the character roster is HUGE (which I wouldn''t have a problem with!) I don''t see&nbsp;Mewtwo&nbsp;coming back - there are already 4 Pokémon in Pikachu,&nbsp;Lucario&nbsp;and the newly announced&nbsp;Greninja&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charizard, and&nbsp;Jigglypuff&nbsp;is more likely to be in it than&nbsp;Mewtwo, IMO.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2014-04-10/palutenaleak.jpg"></div></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2014-04-10/ridley.jpg"></div></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50"><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2014-04-10/zss.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-50"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DcKqf_Wz7ek" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100" style=""></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-50" style=""><div class="col-content edit-col"><img src="/assets/uploads/2014-04-10/Gerudovalley3ds.png"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-50" style=""><p><b>Stages</b></p><p>In addition to showing off those stages that we already knew about, many people''s suspicions were confirmed that the 3DS and Wii U versions will have entirely different stages.

Both modes sound great for different reasons. I personally like having items on, but sometimes it''s good to just get down and fight to the death - and it will certainly suit the competitive scene. And FINALLY, we get to play a Nintendo game online and link it to our Nintendo Network ID. Slowly but surely, Nintendo are finally moving towards a unified account system... twelve years after Microsoft.</p><p>Solo modes also get a bit of online love, too. The also spectacularly named GLOBAL SMASH POWER tells you how many people you outrank worldwide in solo modes. I plan on this number being very, very high.</p><p>Other game modes have also been confirmed - you would assume there will always be the Arcade mode, and All Star mode has been explicitly announced. The Adventure/Subspace Emissary is also back with a slight twist - in a 3DS-only mode ''Smash Run'', you explore a SSE-like dungeon collecting&nbsp;powerups&nbsp;before using those&nbsp;powerups&nbsp;in an all-for-one match.</p><p>Another unique addition is custom move sets. It''s unclear how deep this will go just yet (I don''t think we''ll be able to give Jiggles Falcon Punch) but it certainly looks like it''ll be good to mess around with, powering up certain moves and quickening others. It''s too early to tell whether this will be used frequently, but it certainly will be a good mode to mess around with.</p><p><b>Who''s looking good?</b></p><p>My mains from Brawl were&nbsp;Lucario&nbsp;and Ike. Ike hasn''t been confirmed, so how''s&nbsp;Lucario&nbsp;looking?&nbsp;He''s basically just been powered up and given a mega evolution (which I assume is his final smash).&nbsp; So, awesome.</p><p>Aside from that, Little Mac looks good - almost too good, in fact, and I can see him being REALLY overpowered and overused online. Mega Man and&nbsp;Greninja&nbsp;look sweet too, and Wii Fit Trainer has a really interesting and unique&nbsp;moveset.&nbsp;</p><p>I''ll play with all the fighters as much as I can, though: I can see me sinking a LOT of hours into this game.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

In what was definitely a response to that blog specifically rather than the writer''s own instincts or feelings or feedback from the Archer&nbsp;fanbase&nbsp;(&lt;/sarcasm&gt;) Adam Reed responded by completely shaking up the formula and delivering, what I feel, is the best series of Archer yet. Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;y''all.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The main thing that had been lacking last season was any reasonable character development. It appeared that every character had reached the end of their cycle - Archer was a dysfunctional&nbsp;manchild, Lana was wound up too tight, Mallory was the worst mother in the world, Pam was a sex fiend, Cheryl was a retard and Cyril was a loser. By ditching ISIS from the equation, all of these characters had to drop out of their established roles to adapt to the new lifestyle they''d acquired, and the show evolved them perfectly. Whilst they all retained their existing personalities, the&nbsp;Flanderisation&nbsp;has stopped and the characters have becomes entirely different.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Archer''s newfound maturity and willingness to step up to the possibility of fatherhood has been a surprise, but one that is equally&nbsp;</span><span>matched by his mother''s display of maternal instincts that have been lacking since the very first episode. Cheryl - although still stupid - has finally shown some ambition and, with the help of her peers, the drive to achieve her dream of becoming a country superstar. Pam''s transition from a sex addict to a cocaine addict was a little sudden (and poorly received by the&nbsp;weirdos&nbsp;on /r/ArcherFX) but still added a new dimension to her character that we haven''t otherwise seen. Even Cyril managed to take the initiative to stop sucking so much and overthrow the dictatorship of the country of San Marcos - only to take the dictatorship for himself, which is the perfect traditional thing for Cyril to do. Lana also proved she really was baby crazy and almost a bit stalker-esque&nbsp;by actively seeking out Archer''s sperm that he had donated to have a baby.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The entire "sell a literal, not figurative, ton of cocaine" was a complete and utter failure. Hilariously, they managed to lose the entire stash. This again has prompted criticism from&nbsp;redditors&nbsp;who would rather the whole show consisted of "ants" and "danger zone" - but it''s a comedy, and success is rarely funny, whilst failure is comedy gold.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>The episodes that take place in San Marcos are possibly my favourite ever - each insulting one-liner is laced with the dripping sarcasm and ingenuity that existed pre-season 4, mixed in with the traditional jokes that have earned Archer its cult following and actually providing an overarching plot development.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Season 6 is going to return to ISIS, doing contracts for the CIA, which I think makes total sense - but putting the crew into a new situation to force them to create new traits was perfect, and they can now go back to ISIS with a fresh start. I''m also hoping that some of the scenes from Archer''s&nbsp;flashforward&nbsp;not included in this season make an appearance - like "I think we just accidentally invaded Laos". Was really hoping we''d get to see how Archer penetrated the borders.... wait, are we not doing phrasing anymore?</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'I swear I had something for this', N'archer, archer fx, danger zone, reddit is full of spastics', '20140502 15:23:51', '20140502 15:23:51', 1, 1)

Until mid-march, four teams were in genuine contention to win the league, and it wasn''t until the final fortnight that it became a two-horse race.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Pool fans will be justifiably gutted at the manner in which they let the league slip away from them, but that''s what happens when your defence is better at scoring goals than stopping them. Nevertheless, their football has been a joy to watch all season long and Brendan Rodgers is 100% manager of the year despite narrowly missing out on the title. City, as always, both entertained and terrified by destroying nearly every team they came across.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The highlight of the season was undoubtedly Liverpool''s 3-2 win over City at&nbsp;Anfield&nbsp;which was an astonishingly brilliant game. Gerrard rallied his players to ''not let this slip'' which proved to be tragically ironic when he slipped over in the next game and handed the title to their competitors. Despite this, he has been instrumental for Liverpool this season and he captains my Best XI selection for the way he has dictated games in his deeper-lying midfield role.</span></p><p><span>For the first time since I''ve started recording my Best XI, Joe Hart is not in it. He perhaps got a little cocky in the first few months of the season and was in poor form, but when he returned to the squad after a timeout by&nbsp;Pellegrini, he came back better than ever. However, there are at least four goalies I can name that deserve the honour better than him this season. David De&nbsp;Gea&nbsp;has been Manchester United''s only highlight in a season that they will want to forget very quickly, and likewise for David Marshall of Cardiff City. Other special mentions go to the ever present Petr&nbsp;Cech&nbsp;and Hugo&nbsp;Lloris&nbsp;of Chelsea and Tottenham respectively.<br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p></p>

The only reason he''s only made the bench for my squad is the fact that Cahill and Terry''s partnership in the Chelsea defence this season has been unparalleled. I feel a little ashamed to say that I wish Terry was going to the World Cup with England because he''s a dirty, cheating, racist scumbag, but he''s a million miles better than our second best option&nbsp;Jagielka. The full-back positions go to Leighton Baines and Pablo&nbsp;Zabaleta, providing cover forward and back consistently all season.</span><br></p><p>Where would Arsenal be if Aaron Ramsey had stayed fit? More importantly, what the hell happened to him last summer? He used to be terrible, but this season he has been absolutely sensational. Perhaps it was the £100 million sale of another Welshman that spurred him into becoming a good player. Nevertheless, well done to him for a superb year.&nbsp;On the other hand, we have always been aware of my final two midfielder''s abilities and they brought them out yet again. Eden Hazard, the brilliant Belgian with the incredible name, and my personal player of the season&nbsp;YayaToure&nbsp;(despite his increasingly ridiculous off-field dramas).</p><p>Midfielders who just missed the cut were Southampton''s English prodigy Adam&nbsp;Lallana&nbsp;and Chelsea''s Oscar, both of whom had brilliant seasons but were competing with truly special players. If I had more room on the bench I''d also include&nbsp;PhillipeCoutinho.</p><p>I felt that I had to include all four of the above midfielders, but that left me with the difficult decision of which striker to leave on the bench between Suarez,&nbsp;Aguero&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sturridge. My heart wants to say&nbsp;Sturridge&nbsp;because of his English roots but honesty has to prevail and the two South Americans who have proved so deadly round off the best eleven of the season.</p><p>Thoughts move now to the World Cup; my favourite event of the football calendar. How well am I expecting England to do? Not very. If we make it out of the group I will consider the competition a rousing success. I believe it''s certainly doable, as we''re a fairly even match for both Italy and Uruguay, but it''s going to be extremely difficult. Predictions? Brazil-Argentina final with Brazil to win. England to get knocked out on penalties in the quarter finals. Suarez to Madrid.&nbsp;Lallana&nbsp;to Liverpool.&nbsp;Ibrahimovic&nbsp;OR&nbsp;Cavani&nbsp;for Chelsea OR Arsenal (my money''s on&nbsp;Mourinho).&nbsp;</p><p>3 weeks to go and I am fucking psyched.</p><br><p></p>

They''re presented in a beautiful 3D environment, though, with various camera effects when your players take free kicks or do an awesome dribble, and the games are genuinely fun to watch.

I''m all for accessibility in what is traditionally a convoluted genre but this simply takes it too far to the point that sometimes, it feels like your choice as a manager make little to no difference to a game. You can also only change tactics mid-game if you make a substitution at the same time, which is rather annoying. The only real depth is trying to find all the combinations of training cards to train your players, which quickly becomes a little dull.</p><p>It''s nice to have the SpotPass teams like Spain and Italy to challenge, but when you can''t even get out of the third division due to your players'' poor decisions (too often they shoot from 40 yards when there are plenty of passing options, or do the opposite and pass to a marked player when they have an open goal) it''s frustrating that - unless you invest a lot of time into the game quickly - you''re not going to stand much chance against them.</p><p>It''s got a pretty good online community, though, as well as StreetPass features, which do add a fair bit to the longevity of the game. The DLC also helps the game feel fresh. If you like management sims and are looking for something relatively casual without the heavy investment you need to put into Football Manager, it''s 10 quid very well spent.</p>

To be able to determine whether or not this is true, let''s define the word.</span></p><p></p><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><p></p><p><span><i>Revolutionary:<br></i></span><i style="line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;">adj. Radically new or innovative; outside or beyond established procedure or principles.</i></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The gameplay of WD has new and innovative elements, but it''d be difficult to say it is ''radically'' new, and it also heavily relies on principles and procedures established in many other series - most notably&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><span>So no,&nbsp;Watch_Dogs&nbsp;is 100%, categorically, not revolutionary.</span></p><p></p><p><span>However, it is still a fantastic, original and unique experience. Hacking is simple - arguably too simple, as it''s essentially a context-sensitive single button. It doesn''t really need to be any more complex, though, and it allows for a lot of fun in manipulating the city well. Using hacking, you can tackle missions in a number of different ways - using stealth and distraction, hacking your enemies'' weapons to use against themselves, or simply using a chain of cameras to reach the object you need to hack. This is supplemented by a solid combat system, and it never stops being fun.</span></p><p></p><p><span>There''s a significant amount of missions, collectibles and side games in addition to an entertaining - if a little clichéd - storyline, and Chicago feels so alive that simply exploring it adds a lot to the overall playability. I can quite easily sit down to play and not realise that three or four hours have passed.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>But what truly makes WD a brilliant game is the online modes. So much thought has gone into these modes and it''s truly paid off. You can be wandering a city, looking for new checkpoint to become Mayor of, and suddenly, you''re being invaded by another player who is attempting to hack you. You have to drop everything to prevent them from stealing your data. Now, as with most online modes there''s no real penalty for failing except losing points in an arbitrary system, but it gives you a rush of panic and excitement. It''s especially good how flawlessly they enter your game - there are ways of telling, such as the ''focus'' system moving at full speed rather than slow motion, and the game still moving when you pause. But these aren''t immediately obvious and are things that you have to figure out. Additionally, being the one to actually invade someone''s game is even more thrilling - watching them run around&nbsp;headlessly, hopelessly trying to find you whilst you blend in to the crowds - be it by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oErX_uHrwk" target="_blank">dancing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZw_k8Pal40" target="_blank">using a cash machine</a> or simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=112ffI0f0Jk" target="_blank">hiding in plain sight</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Then there''s the companion app mode - one player plays via their smartphone, essentially controlling the Chicago Police Department as the other player races against the clock to pass through checkpoints throughout the city, with the same hacking capabilities that you have in the actual game. THIS MODE is worthy of the tag ''revolutionary'', and I truly hope that more games come up with this cross-device gameplay in future, as it''s bloody brilliant.</span></p><p></p><p><span>There are minor criticisms I can level at this game but it''s nothing that takes away from the overall experience - for example, money becomes fairly worthless pretty quickly, and just for once I would love to have an open-world city game where you actually have to earn your own cars and keep them in a garage, rather than just being able to steal the best car in the game within the first 10 minutes. I know with GTA it''s kind of the point, but is it too much to ask for a sandbox city with a little more security? Also, the heat system is kind of broken - you can drive around like a fucking drunk lunatic and nobody gives a toss as long as you don''t kill anybody. But god forbid you look at someone funny and that''s it, the police send out a fucking helicopter.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ubisoft&nbsp;want to make&nbsp;Watch_Dogs&nbsp;an ongoing series in a similar vain to Assassin''s Creed - I mean, that''s great, but considering it took 5 years to make, I don''t see them adding enough content in a year to warrant that kind of regularity. Just off the top of my head, I can tell them that they need to fix the poor AI, boost the underwhelming graphics, make a brand new city and essentially make the whole game feel less like GTA with hacking - at an absolute minimum. They''ve got a fine game here, but if they turn it into a yearly cash cow I can see it losing fans, and fast - unless, of course, they can really make it a revolution.</span></p>

For the book readers, it has proved the be the most contentious.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Producers D</span><span>avid&nbsp;Benioff&nbsp;and D. B. Weiss have been gradually increasing the number and severity of diversions from the source material to the point where some people are getting rather annoyed by it.&nbsp; Some were accepted, like the increased role given to&nbsp;Oberyn&nbsp;Martell before his demise at the hands of the mountain ensured that we had a real connection with him - making his gruesome death even more shocking. However, there were some that were less popular, such as the friendly terms on which&nbsp;Tyrion&nbsp;and Jaime departed one another, or&nbsp;Ygritte''s&nbsp;death, or the lack of Lady&nbsp;Stoneheart&nbsp;in the finale (if you don''t know who that is,&nbsp;</span><span><b>don''t look it up unless you don''t care about spoilers</b></span><span>)</span><span>.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I think it''s important to look at the television series as its own entity; many things in the book would not transfer well to the format of television. This will become increasingly true over the next 2-3 seasons. The fourth and fifth books of&nbsp;</span><span>ASOIAF</span><span>&nbsp;take place alongside each other chronologically, focusing on events in different locations in the world. As a result, main characters - like&nbsp;Tyrion, Jon Snow and&nbsp;Daenerys&nbsp;- make no appearances in the fourth book. I don''t see the TV show succeeding if all of the audience''s&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;characters disappear for a whole season - in fact, the book suffered critically because of this aspect - so it''s much more likely that the two books will be combined in order to tell the story.</span></p><p></p><p><span>That said, it doesn''t stop some decisions being poor. It may be because I knew&nbsp;Ygritte&nbsp;was going to die anyway, but the moment she killed Olly''s parents - coupled with his blatant foreshadowing of "I was the best archer in my village" - it was painfully obvious what was going to happen. His nod after murdering her became a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OllyNodGifs">meme</a></span><span>.</span></p><p></p><p><span>One change I am happy about that most other book readers are not is Jaime and&nbsp;Tyrion''s&nbsp;departure. I always felt that making them leave on such bad terms was not only insult to injury but also shoehorned in for the sake of a bit of extra drama, which ASOS already has plenty of. It''s one detail I always wished was different in the book, so I''m glad for it.</span></p><p></p><p><span>In regards to Lady&nbsp;Stoneheart, there''s still plenty of time for her to appear, so I''m not losing any sleep over it - but I am a little surprised as it would make for an absolutely sensational finale to the series and make people desperate for the next one. As it stands, the ending of Arya and&nbsp;Tyrion&nbsp;setting sail for pastures new definitely sets the tone but is, much like the season 3 ending, underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the season.</span></p><p></p><p><span>There is one small detail that really bugs me and I can''t figure out why they''ve changed it. In A Storm of Swords, when&nbsp;Littlefinger&nbsp;throws&nbsp;Lysa&nbsp;out of the Moon Door and to her death, the dialogue between the two is simple, and yet probably my&nbsp;favourite:</span></p><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div><p><b>Petyr</b>:&nbsp;My sweet silly jealous wife, I''ve only loved one woman, I promise you.<br><span><b>Lysa</b></span><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;Only one?

Only one?<br></span><span><span><b>Petyr</b></span><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;Only&nbsp;</span><span>Cat</span><span>.</span></span></p></div></blockquote><p><span>But they changed "Only Cat" to "Your sister", which just sounds a bit strange, and they cut&nbsp;Lysa''s&nbsp;crazy babbling altogether. It''s a minor point but it left me disgruntled.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, I feel this season is the best so far - every episode has been enthralling and there are some incredible scenes that will go down in television history. The Purple Wedding,&nbsp;Oberyn&nbsp;vs The Mountain,&nbsp;Tyrion''s&nbsp;incredible trial scene that will surely provide Peter&nbsp;Dinklage&nbsp;with yet more awards, the battle on the Wall, and of course,&nbsp;Tywin''s&nbsp;death on the privy. It''s left me hungry for more, but rather than another television series, it''s just given me an appetite to devour the Winds of Winter... hurry up, George, please!</span></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'Game of Thrones season 4 - contentious, yet incredible', N'game of thrones, a song of ice and fire, a storm of swords, peter dinklage, pedro pascal, the mountain, the viper', '20140725 16:17:45', '20140725 16:17:45', 1, 1)

Some of this stems from the fact that it''s a combination of all the least grounded elements from the comic universe, and also that it pulls together five of the most unlikely characters to create a team. But mostly, it''s because the dialogue is so blue and&nbsp;cheesy you could serve it as a side to Buffalo wings.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Even in the more serious moments of the film, the comedy just doesn''t stop - whether it comes from Rocket, the cute little badass, or&nbsp;Drax''s&nbsp;difficulty with metaphors, or Star-Lord''s complete and utter loser-ness. That said, this doesn''t detract one bit from the quality of the action, of which there is plenty, ranging from ridiculous prison break fist-fights to space battles of an epic scale. Although the story is practically identical to that of&nbsp;</span><span>The Avengers</span><span>, there''s enough quality here to set it apart - and, in my view, it is the superior film.</span></p><p></p><p><span>"Awesome Mix Vol. 1" provides the</span><span>&nbsp;excellent soundtrack of 70''s music</span><span>&nbsp;and it keeps the mood upbeat for the duration of the picture, whilst at the same time managing to lend some importance to&nbsp;story and character development. It helps to form the relationship between Star-Lord and&nbsp;Gamora, and acts as a symbol for Peter Quill''s mother who passes away at the beginning of the film - it''s clearly very sentimentally important to him, and he goes to great lengths to protect it. And then he uses the power of dance to distract Ronan just as the end seems nigh in the film''s cheesiest moment of all.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s focus a little more on the character of Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord. He is, for all intents and purposes, the comic book geek''s paragon. They can relate to his social ineptitude but aspire to his success with green women, his outlaw status and, of course, his badass costume that allows him to fly and breathe in space.&nbsp;</span><span>Twenty years ago, he would have been cringed at by all but those loyal Marvel readers. Today, he is&nbsp;</span><span>cool.</span><span>&nbsp;C</span><span>omics are no longer limited to the odd, derided schoolboy that wore horn-rimmed spectacles in the back-left corner of the classroom. They are the source material for some of the most critically and commercially successful films of all time.</span></p><p></p><p><span>How, and when, did this happen?&nbsp;</span><span>Whilst many comic book film series - like&nbsp;</span><span>Superman,</span><span>X-Men,&nbsp;</span><span>Tim Burton''s&nbsp;</span><span>Batman</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>Spider-Man -</span><span>&nbsp;had been relatively successful it''s pretty safe to say that they were never considered to be top-quality cinema.&nbsp;</span><span>It probably began with&nbsp;</span><span>Iron Man&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>The Dark Knight&nbsp;</span><span>in 2008</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>and is becoming slowly more true with each new adaptation.</span><span>&nbsp;Christopher Nolan''s take on Batman especially revitalised the public interest in superhero movies by taking a fresh look at the grittier side of the character, which Tim Burton had touched upon in 1989 but was too afraid to go whole hog, and Robert Downey Jr. has become the definitive Iron Man through his stellar performances.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It''s not surprising that these were the first two characters to become popular - they are rich, suave and intelligent characters that are portrayed by popular big-name actors - but since then the Marvel films have provided a platform for other slightly lesser-known actors (and perhaps less traditionally cool characters) to shine. The two that immediately jump to mind are Chris Hemsworth''s Thor and Chris Evans'' Captain America. Although both actors were far from unknowns, they''ve managed to carve out a career-defining role (let''s face it, the Captain America films are much better than Fantastic Four ever was), and so it may prove to be for Chris Pratt: despite his other roles, he will probably now be known forever more as Star-Lord, and to be quite honest, it''s a hell of a compliment to his performance.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The public''s new-found love for comic book movies has led to Guardians of the Galaxy setting an August opening weekend record of a cool $94 million.

It''s sad that we cannot celebrate the emergence of a fantastic new heavy metal group without bringing up the rather sensitive topic of an ex-bandmate attempting to hire a&nbsp;hitman</span><span>to knock off his wife, but in the case of&nbsp;Wovenwar&nbsp;it has to be done because it''s at the core of the differences between the bands.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Gone with Tim&nbsp;Lambesis''&nbsp;</span><span>are the heavy shouting vocals, and in comes Oh, Sleeper''s clean vocalist Shane&nbsp;Blay. Aside from that,&nbsp;Wovenwar''slineup&nbsp;is unchanged from As I Lay Dying, right down to the album producer from Awakened, Bill Stevenson.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>The sound is familiar, and yet utterly&nbsp;different.&nbsp;Wovenwar&nbsp;is arguably not a&nbsp;metalcore&nbsp;band; the heavy breakdowns are still there but to a much less dramatic extent, and there''s a heavier leaning towards the genre''s&nbsp;melodeath&nbsp;roots - songs like&nbsp;</span><span>The Tempest</span><span>&nbsp;sound like they could easily have been written by&nbsp;Soilwork, for example - and unlike AILD, the slowest songs on the album (Father/Son and Prophets) are&nbsp;</span><span>actually</span><span>&nbsp;slow ballads as opposed to a&nbsp;metalcore&nbsp;song with the distortion turned down a little. Even outside of the vocals, it''s a considerably lighter album than anything ever released with&nbsp;Lambesis&nbsp;in the band.</span></p><p></p><p><span>One of the most noticeable differences for me is the lack of focus on Jordan&nbsp;Mancino''s&nbsp;drumming which has been turned down significantly for the album, and more focus given to the vocals.&nbsp;</span><span>The&nbsp;riffwork&nbsp;on some songs bear all the hallmarks of&nbsp;Hipa&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sgrosso''s&nbsp;striking style, most noticeably on The Mason, and the lead single, All Rise, both of which sound like they could have been lifted from AILD''s Shadows Are Security album.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Unfortunately some other songs do blend into&nbsp;genericity, and at an above-average 54 minutes in length, it''s of my opinion that the album could have done without songs like Moving Up.</span></p><p></p><p><span>That said, 90% of the album is superb and it''s apparent that there is life for the band members going forward. I''m sure they don''t want sympathy but as a massive fan of the music it''s an absolute shame to see As I Lay Dying go down, and it would be completely unfair for the rest of the band to lose their reputation as outstanding people and musicians due to the antics of a&nbsp;roid-raging friend.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Here''s to a new era.</span></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Music', N'Wovenwar - a new era of As I Lay Dying', N'as i lay dying, tim lambesis, wovenwar, shane blay, jordan mancino, nick hipa, phil sgrosso, josh gilbert', '20140815 13:26:10', '20140815 13:26:10', 1, 1)

There''s no doubt that they’re a lighter band than they used to be, but oddly enough a metal band''s quality is defined by more than just how heavy they are - in fact, by going a little bit lighter they''ve managed to come up with the perfect blend of melodic death metal on more than one occasion, which for me peaked when the incredible&nbsp;</span><span><i>Come Clarity&nbsp;</i></span><span>released in 2006.&nbsp;</span><span>Since then,&nbsp;</span><span><i>A Sense of Purpose&nbsp;</i></span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span><i>Sounds of a Playground Fading</i></span><span>&nbsp;have been fairly good, but not managing to reach the dizzying heights of the three albums that preceded them.

"It''s so simple!" they said. "Apple are so innovative!" they said.&nbsp;</span><span>And yet after having three iPhones break down on me in the space of two years and the new "innovations" being rip-offs of two-year old Android phones, I decided enough was enough. I am back on Android and my phone feels like an extension of me again.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The HTC One (M8) is a high-end smartphone with comparable power to that of the iPhone 6 for nearly half the price - shifted down from £42/m to £27/m with no up-front cost. I actually made money by selling the iPhone 5 back for £160. So, I guess that''s something.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It uses a modified version of Android known as HTC Sense that changes the default user experience and it runs oh-so-smoothly. I can finally run emulators on my phone again, and oh - I can test out app development without having to jump through hoops of building a provisioning profile then uploading it to a third party site then installing profiles on my device and so on and so on. And I can change it to look however the fuck I want, instead of being involved in the Clone Wars of the smartphone world.</span></p><p><span>One ridiculous usability flaw in HTC Sense is the security feature that deletes all the phone data after ten incorrect PIN inputs. ALL your data. And there''s no way to turn it off.

To which I retort, you’re shit at reading them.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I''ve been gradually making the transition from web to fully-fledged software which started with an OS X widget earlier this year, moving on to maintenance of existing Android applications, before finally a few months ago getting stuck in from the ground up on both Android and iOS. I''m glad I had the opportunity to compare the two development worlds synchronously, as it''s given me the opportunity to compare and contrast the various frustrations and satisfactions that both platforms provide.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I''ll start with IDEs. There''s a large number available but I began development with the most common - Eclipse for Android, and&nbsp;Xcode&nbsp;for iOS. I was already familiar with&nbsp;Xcode&nbsp;due to my previous dabble in OS X applications but Eclipse was an entirely new boat for me. They both have superb code completion mechanisms that help speed up coding, and Eclipse in particular has a lot of keyboard shortcuts for intelligent imports and other similar time-saving economies. Both are efficient and have detailed, excellent debugging views. On balance,&nbsp;Xcode&nbsp;is probably slightly more intuitive - but there''s not much to choose between the two. A tie here.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Moving on to the simulators, and Apple wins hands down. Quite how they managed to get such a smooth emulator of iOS running is nothing short of a technical masterpiece - indeed, it actually seems to run better than the devices themselves. Whether this is a testament to being well-optimised&nbsp;on OS X or the iPad being an overpriced bastard is another matter entirely and one that I won''t go into because&nbsp;</span><span>you all know the answer anyway</span><span>. Comparatively, the Android emulators are appalling. Like, really, really bad. They''re so atrociously slow that you may as well not use them. When you launch a virtual device, go put the kettle on. Come back and then it may have started. Once you''ve drunk your tea, your app may have launched. Then you can deal with a frame rate that maxes out at around 4 per second. I''ve heard whispers on the&nbsp;intercyberwebbything&nbsp;that the newly-released Android Studio provides a much better emulator than the one that comes with&nbsp;Eclipse+ADT, but I cannot testify to that as I haven''t used it. Which brings me nicely on to my next point...</span></p><p></p><p><span>Testing on devices, the complete reverse is true. Despite how good&nbsp;Xcode''s&nbsp;iOS simulator is, there will&nbsp;</span><span>always</span><span>&nbsp;be bugs or errors on the real device that cannot be replicated on a simulator. This is to be expected and nothing wrong with that. However, the process to get an iOS app onto a live device for testing is excruciating.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>First, you have to get an apple developer account. That costs $99/year. I mean, cool, you''re paying to rent out use of their store. But... even if you''re not using the store, you need to pay. That''s not cool. But whatever, chances are you''re going to use the store, so let''s get over that. Then you need to add your device to a list of approved devices to run this app called a ''provisioning profile''. Then, once you''ve done that, you need to download that profile locally so that you can build your app and bundle it for this specific provisioning profile. Great! You''ve got your package. Can I install it on my iPad?&nbsp;</span><span>No.&nbsp;</span><span>Instead, you have to sign up for a third-party service (fortunately, it''s free) and use their kind of half-arsed&nbsp;version control to download and install onto individual iPads. That''s not disrespecting&nbsp;TestFlight, it''s a pretty good solution; just to a problem that shouldn''t exist in the first place.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s compare this to Android''s process. You plug your device into a USB port. You run it on the device instead of a virtual one.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Compare the length of those last two paragraphs and you''ll understand my frustrations of having to do this every time I need to test an app outside the simulator.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Finally, let''s talk about the languages. I always despised Java whilst learning it at University but now I''ve got my head around its many quirks I''ve decided it''s an average language that does the job and I will persevere with it. The bigger problem is XML. Fuck using XML for layouts, it''s awful. It''s like a much, much worse version of using HTML, trying to make it better by using custom elements. I try to avoid using XML and draw the layouts dynamically but I''m sure some ''true'' Android&nbsp;devs&nbsp;will be staunchly against that. I''ve already covered Objective-C before, and not much has changed since then, but for some reason on iOS the coordinates&nbsp;</span><span>do</span><span>&nbsp;draw from the top-left corner, and not the bottom-left as on OS X. I mean, this is better, but I''m still a bit confused. Whatever. It''s still got those silly square brackets. At least the storyboarding is OK.</span></p><p></p><p><span>On balance, iOS programming is better. It''s a lot easier to make beautiful applications and I can see why half of the apps on the Play Store looks like balls compared to those on the App Store. However, Android programming has the advantage of being instantly deployable, which I like. It''s let me create a number of personal apps that won''t ever see the light of day publicly but allow me to do what I want with something that I own without having to pay a ridiculous fee.</span></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p><span>Once every year the&nbsp;fartiest&nbsp;of our arty-farts get together to declare which pompous piece of self-indulgent cinema is the most pompous and checks off the most of their criteria for being self-indulgent. I have a bit of disdain for most Oscar nominees, which so often throw entertainment value out of the window in the name of artistic expression, and even then, they frequently fall short of the artistic value that realistically&nbsp;</span><span>should&nbsp;</span><span>be required of what is voted the best film of the year.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s look at&nbsp;</span><span>Foxcatcher</span><span>, for example.&nbsp;Foxcatcher&nbsp;- in my opinion - is a bad film. I went into it expecting a taut, tense drama with complex characters and an engaging script. Instead (spoilers ahead), what I got was extended periods of awkward silences between one-dimensional people until one had enough of the incredibly boring film and decided he had to shoot someone.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It''s not like they couldn''t have done anything with the story - the real life case of John du Pont and Mark Schultz is one that fascinates, but in the screen version, JDP and Schultz'' relationship can be summed up by homoerotic cuddling in the first half, and toddler-levels of sulking in the second.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>The entire relationship is based around one event where Schultz skips a training session and is hit by Du Pont. And then they just don''t really speak to&nbsp;eachother&nbsp;for the rest of the film. Not that Channing Tatum has much to say at all. His sulky, moody persona is lifted straight from a Ryan Gosling film, but unlike&nbsp;</span><span>Drive</span><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span>The Place Beyond The Pines</span><span>, they''ve completely overshot ''tense and mysterious'' and hit ''awkward and boring''. The primary cause of this is a complete lack of interesting dialogue between characters, all of whom are apparently a species that struggle to communicate with human beings.</span></p><p></p><p><span>In fact, the only character that seems remotely like a real person is Dave Schultz, very well played by Mark&nbsp;Ruffalo. That''s not to criticise the performances of Steve Carrell - notably out of his typecast - or Tatum, but&nbsp;Ruffalo&nbsp;is the only one who actually has any bloody lines.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s compare this to&nbsp;</span><span>Birdman</span><span>. Birdman is absolutely brilliant</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;It''s a very different sort of film - it would be unfair to say that Birdman is a better film simply because it is inherently a more entertaining genre of film. But there are a few parallels that immediately highlight the shortcomings of&nbsp;Foxcatcher&nbsp;and how you can do a film where not a lot really happens very well.</span></p><p></p><ul><li><p><span>Primary characters: John Du Pont, vs&nbsp;Riggan&nbsp;Thomson. Both are looking for something missing in their lives and trying to regain it through a comeback of some kind - whether that be wrestling or acting. Both are lonely and companionless, although Du Pont much more so than Thomson, and both are utterly, dangerously insane. D</span><span>espite their similarities on the outside, it''s easy to see that Du Pont is a much more introverted and socially challenged person than Thomson, who exudes confidence and charisma. However, this in itself lends to better watching. We&nbsp;</span><span>know</span><span>&nbsp;that the characters are mentally disturbed, so why not run with it? I admit, Birdman''s OTT approach of voices-in-your-head-and-imagining-superpowers is completely inappropriate for a film like&nbsp;Foxcatcher, it''s a million miles better than the subtle-not-subtle approach that we get.&nbsp;</span><span>Some</span><span>&nbsp;emotion would be nice.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Supporting cast: those responsible for helping the primary characters achieve their goals end up actively sabotaging it, partially intentionally, partially not. Birdman introduces Mike Shiner with my personal nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Edward Norton. Shiner is a prima donna who frequently lets his emotions get the better of him, causing</span><span>tension and friction between himself and the other major characters. Mark Schultz has a perpetual tantrum. The tension feels very real in Birdman, with the threat of it bursting ever hanging in the air. This intensity is completely lacking in&nbsp;</span><span>Foxcatcher.</span></p></li></ul>

It''s very clear, in both films, what is going to happen for some time before it does. But because Birdman has been bubbling with this intensity for so long now, when&nbsp;Riggan&nbsp;shoots himself, it''s a relief of all the mental stress that he, and the audience, have experienced throughout the rollercoaster of preparation. When John Du Pont shoots Dave Schultz, the only relief I had was that the film was finally drawing to a close, after watching two hours of mostly non-eventful training for wrestling, with very little dialogue.</p></li></ul><p>And all this is before I''ve got into the technical mastery of editing that is Birdman - the entire film, save for one short montage when&nbsp;Riggan&nbsp;has shot himself, is edited to look like one long shot, with the clever use of doorways and camera angles allowing for cutting between different takes. This, my friends, is what cinematic art looks like - what must have been months upon months of planning, storyboarding, shooting and re-shooting and the end result is something that is not only artistically spectacular but also adds something to the&nbsp;enjoyability&nbsp;of the film. And&nbsp;that&nbsp;is the kind of film that should win awards for best film of the year.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p>Most of the people who ridicule the&nbsp;Fifty Shades of Grey&nbsp;cinema adaptation haven''t even been to see it. It’s a little unfair. So here''s a few things about it that you may need to know before you do ridicule it (which you should, because it''s bad).</p><ol><li><p>Anastasia Steele''s character is horrendous. My fiancée informs me that she was in fact even more dull and intolerable in the books, and that the film almost made her look interesting by comparison. Yes, she''s supposed to be a "Plain Jane" type character, but there''s plain, and then there''s completely devoid of any personality whatsoever. She''s just a vessel for E.L. James to project her sexual fantasies on and in to.&nbsp;The one single defining characteristic she owns is that she doesn''t have a coherent train of thought. She likes Grey, then doesn''t because he''s a creepy sex fiend, then does because he buys her something expensive, then she kind of likes the creepy sex stuff, then decides she doesn''t for absolutely no reason whatsoever. The only real conflict in the plot is driven by her not making any fucking sense.</p></li><li><p>The creepy sex stuff isn''t even especially creepy. Head into the downstairs of your local Ann Summers - a high street shop - and you''ll see a room not too different to Grey''s "sex dungeon". For a series that has garnered such publicity for its portrayal of sex, it involves a little bit of spanking with various objects and that''s more or less it.&nbsp;And additionally, there isn’t very much sex at all. This isn''t a good thing or a bad thing; it''s just a curious thing. Sex is very thematically relevant, but there are very few scenes in which it takes place. Whilst the media coverage would have you believe that the entire book is basically one long romp, if the movie really is true to the book (which, admittedly, I can''t confirm) it seems to me that perhaps it''s been wrongly defined as erotica when romantic drama seems more appropriate. There''s more sex in the&nbsp;<i>A&nbsp;</i><i>Song of Ice and Fire</i>&nbsp;series or in Pat Barker''s First World War trilogy, but they''re not defined as erotica.</p></li><li><p>Christian Grey is attempted to be portrayed as this deep, troubled man with a lot of complicated layers but in reality the depth is pretty artificial and he''s just a bit of a sulk. When he can''t get what he wants, he bullies or buys his way into getting it. The idea of the contract is actually one of the better elements of the film, as it aptly shows his character''s need to control everything, but it''s handled with as much subtlety as a nuclear bomb. Either way, he''s a much more interesting character than Anastasia.</p></li><li><p>The script. My god. I will admit that dialogue is not my strong point in writing but if E.L. James thinks this passes for acceptable conversation then I am going to win the Booker Prize for the next ten fucking years. The upshot of this is that it actually makes the film unintentionally hilarious, and as a result it may well unwittingly become comedy of the year.</p></li><li><p>It truly is really fucking bad, but honestly, it''s not pull-your-eyes-out-with-hooks bad like&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City 2&nbsp;</i>or the Indiana Jones film that shall not be named. In reality it''s not really any worse than sitting through any other doe-eyed romance film. It''s basically a result of taking a script on par with&nbsp;The Room&nbsp;and putting into the hands of a relatively competent cast and crew - they''ve actually done a pretty good job considering the utter trite they had to work with.</p></li></ol></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Film and TV', N'Shit film, but there''s worse.', N'shitty films', '20150224 11:41:41', '20150224 11:41:41', 1, 1)

Seven-year-old me didn''t have the patience for this, as&nbsp;Raymanis a very challenging game.&nbsp;Fortunately, I''m a much more experienced gamer now, so that coupled with the fact that I have 30 continues rather than 5 means I should be able to get through it breezily.&nbsp;</p><p>It''s a game that absolutely requires patience and accuracy, and rushing through it will mean you die and swear a lot. Compared to some other games of this age, though,&nbsp;it’s your own mistakes that punish you rather than awkward mechanics. It does feel very primitive - like an expanded version of the example games bundled with software like Game Maker - but to be honest, it doesn''t need to be any more complicated than it is. It''s a platformer and it''s simple. Where it comes into its own is its unique brand of humour and colourful charm. Seven-year-old me would laugh himself silly the first time he saw&nbsp;Rayman&nbsp;throw his fist at an enemy, and although the novelty has worn off over the years,&nbsp;Rayman''s&nbsp;facial expressions are still as entertaining as ever.</p><p></p></div><div class="col edit-col col-33 movable resizable editable"><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2015-02-25/mrstone.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-66"><p></p><p>One addition to the 3DS version that''s a little bit awkward is that when the in-game photographer takes a photo of&nbsp;Rayman&nbsp;to act as a checkpoint during the level, the 3DS camera takes a photo of you. Which, to be honest, fits in quite nicely with the quirky nature of the game, but it''s kind of awkward when you''re trying to take a shit. Also, because the 3DS camera insists on loudly snapping regardless of whether the volume is up or not, and even with headphones in, playing it on the bus attracts some odd looks from others around you - especially when you''ve just died twenty times on Mr. Stone''s Peaks.</p><p></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p></p><p>And what has made me utterly rage is that the level complete them has been removed from the 3DS version.&nbsp;Rayman&nbsp;keeps his ''YEAH!'', but the tune and weird laugh that go along with it has been completely removed. What an absolute piss take.</p><p>So, is&nbsp;Rayman worth revisiting twenty years on? I would say yes, but don''t get the 3DS version - try and get the original, with all sound effects and your selfie-less pride intact.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

In fact, it won album of the year at the ever-prestigious <a href="http://www.declantyson.net/dec-awards-2009">2009 DEC Awards</a>. Maybe you heard about it. Robert Downey Jr was there.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="col edit-col movable resizable editable col-25"><div class="col-content"><img src="/assets/uploads/2015-04-08/telllies.jpg"></div></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p>I say relatively. It has still shot to the top of the UK Album Charts and there''s been some guerrilla marketing involving the Houses of Parliament and Shoreditch underground station, but the singles from the album, by and large, have bombed.</p><p>On first listen it''s easy to see why, really - it lacks some of the more mainstream, commercial appeal of older&nbsp;Prodigy and with the huge masses of posters adorning the walls of Shoreditch,&nbsp;Dalston&nbsp;and Stoke Newington, it''s clear they feel that they''ve made an album for some of the more die-hard fans of electronic music.</p><p>I have to admit, first time through I wasn''t sure I enjoyed it - the whole sound has been produced to feel very garage-esque&nbsp;and a little underground, with less rock and experimental influences than some of their previous works. That being said, it gets a lot more enjoyable if you give it&nbsp; time and patience. Whilst, in my opinion, it''s not as consistently good as&nbsp;IMD,&nbsp;it certainly has some highlights. The title track''s heavy drum beat is a hell of a good pacemaker for a workout, and you can tell there''s quite a bit of anger poured into its composition.</p><p>In fact, angry is a good word to describe most of the album''s tracks. Liam&nbsp;Howlett&nbsp;sounds particularly pissed off in&nbsp;<i>Ibiza</i>, where he pretty blatantly attacks the music played by DJs (presumably, Ibizan DJs in particular) as ''too darn dull'' and repeatedly asks the question: ''What''s he fuckin''&nbsp;doin''!?''. &nbsp;Similarly,&nbsp;<i>Get Your Fight On, Nasty</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Destroy</i>&nbsp;all live up to their aggressive titles.&nbsp;Not every track is so fierce, though -&nbsp;<i>Wild Frontier</i>&nbsp;is probably my favourite track on the album, drawing heavy influences from drum and bass whilst maintaining an air of slight peace.</p><p>The album ends on a high with the extra-heavy&nbsp;<i>Wall of Death</i>&nbsp;but unfortunately most of the other tracks are forgettable or just, quite honestly, not particularly good. I''ll probably end up cherry-picking individual songs to put in a wider playlist, but even after a few listens, I don''t find it close to as compelling as some of their earlier works. Maybe I''ve just grown out of the anger of teenage youth so it doesn''t hit as close to home, but at any rate, most of this album simply isn''t for me.</p><p></p>

Spring was here, and it was declared that the time is right for&nbsp;Mewtwo&nbsp;to descend on Smash, and for games to be given to those passing in the street.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Since the 3DS has launched, people have been passing in Chicago, passing in New Orleans, in New York City...&nbsp;</span><span>South America, Australia, France, Germany, UK, Africa... the list goes on. New games cemented the fact that they would continue playing and passing in the street.</span></p><p></p><p>In<i>&nbsp;</i><i>StreetPass&nbsp;Zombies</i>,&nbsp;known in the US as&nbsp;<i>Battleground Z</i>,&nbsp;it doesn''t matter what your hobby is - it has a kooky weapon assigned to it to take down a horde of undead in a stage-based action game. It''s one of the better of all the&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games despite its lack of any real depth, and it''s a little too easy, but it plays like a PG version of&nbsp;<i>Lollipop Chainsaw</i>&nbsp;- which, for four quid, is pretty good value for what equates to a fun little game. The rare zombies aren''t super easy to find, though, and gives a lot of replay value to all the zombies grabbing&nbsp;Miis&nbsp;everywhere around the world, and you''ll keep passing in the street.</p><p></p><p>You can also extend an invitation across the nation to the Nintendo Islands in&nbsp;<i>StreetPass&nbsp;Fishing</i>,&nbsp;aka&nbsp;<i>Ultimate Angler</i>.&nbsp;It''s a chance for&nbsp;Miis&nbsp;to meet and share fishing bait and go after mythical sea creatures. It''s a bit like&nbsp;<i>StreetPass&nbsp;Garden</i>&nbsp;(or whatever ridiculously OTT name the yanks gave that), in that it''s chill as fuck and you can present your prized collection of fish/flowers to the passers in the street after. It''s also less frustrating than <i>Garden</i> because you don''t have to rely on an RNG giving you a decent seed to complete the damn game.&nbsp;The ultimate in relaxation,&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;Fishing&nbsp;will have your&nbsp;Miis&nbsp;laughing and singing, fishing rods swinging, as you keep passing in the street.</p>

Kudos to Messrs. Bowie and Jagger for creating such an iconic song that can be so aptly repurposed for a video game review by a bored software developer 20 years later. I''m sure that''s all they could ever have dreamed of.</i><br></p></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-50"><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G4jnaznUoQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p>Seriously though, as a package I prefer these two games to the original four. They''re both fun for different reasons. Both can be played daily in 5-10 minutes bursts if you get a decent amount of hits, making them the ideal&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games, and they both just have that feel-good factor that only Nintendo can seem to get right. If you enjoyed the first batch of new games - or indeed, even the original&nbsp;<i>Puzzle Swap</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>StreetPass&nbsp;Quest</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;then these two games are a must get at a price of £6 combined. If you''re on the fence about all of them, I would recommend&nbsp;<i>Fishing</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Zombies</i>&nbsp;over&nbsp;<i>Squad, Garden, Battle</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mansion</i>.&nbsp;And I probably don''t need to tell you this, but right now there''s no reason to pay the extra cash for the premium plaza. I think it allows you to get extra plaza tickets by collecting people''s birthdays in Nintendo''s ever-weirder style of DLC - but unless you want to collect all the speech bubbles and the shitty hats, then you''ll probably get enough tickets just from the games.<br></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

Truth be told, it wasn''t the best. Chelsea had the league all but wrapped up by the time Santa had got home in what was to be the most boring team to ever win a Premier League title. They even parked the bus when they were crowned champions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Still, you can''t fault&nbsp;Mourinho. At the end of the day, the objective is to win, not to entertain, and watching him fire bullets of sarcasm at his rivals ultimately made up for some of the drab football.&nbsp;He put together an astonishing team in front of his already solid defence, including&nbsp;Ivanovic&nbsp;and Terry. They re-signed&nbsp;NemanjaMatic&nbsp;for a whopping 14 times the price they paid for him the first time, but it''s proven to be a good one as he has been a huge part of Chelsea''s ability to throttle teams into stagnation. Fabregas - who I can honestly say I never expected to see in a Chelsea shirt - has been astonishingly good in his creative midfield role and, combined with the ever-improving Eden Hazard, just keeps on racking up the assists. Then there''s Costa - the answer to all of Chelsea''s striker woes. Ba and Torres just didn''t strike fear into defences like this guy. He''s also&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;dirty and will do whatever it takes to win, much like one&nbsp;bitey&nbsp;striker sorely missing from Liverpool this season.</span></p>

And also making waves in North London is Harry Kane, who looks set to become one of the bright stars for the future. The only other player from the top 5 teams to make it in is United''s superb goalkeeper David De&nbsp;Gea, who looks set to leave for Real Madrid in the summer.</p><p>The team is rounded out by Southampton pair Jose Fonte and Ryan Bertrand. Southampton have been this years surprise package - after being picked apart by other clubs in the summer, many predicted them for relegation, but they have defied that by conceding the second lowest tally of goals in the league and genuinely challenging for a Champions League spot right up until April. They still may get Europa League if Arsenal beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup Final, in what is already their most successful season ever. They''ve certainly captured my heart.</p><p>There''s little football to tide me over until August, but the late Champion''s League final will be welcome - although not as welcome as the news that the corrupt, slave labour-supporting prats who run world football may finally be getting what they deserve.</p><p>I''m not against the ideas of having a winter World Cup. Nor do I in principle object to the idea of having it in Qatar. I can even get over the fact that they bought it. No, it''s&nbsp;the barbaric conditions in which Nepalese migrants are forced to work without pay - or indeed, without permission to leave the country - in preparation for the spectacle. I keep hearing calls to boycott the tournament, but that''s not going to save the lives of potentially thousands of people in the seven years up until then, is it? No, we need change much sooner than that.&nbsp;</p><p>So what''s the answer?</p><p>If Qatar is serious about hosting the world''s greatest event, then - when Blatter is hopefully finally prized free of his dictator-like grasp on the organisation - FIFA should offer an ultimatum. Give them the chance to keep the WC, but only if they can dramatically improve their worker''s rights laws by, say, 2018. If this hasn''t happened, then take it away. Give it to America, or Australia. Hell, maybe they should just do that anyway.<br></p>

</div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p></p><p><span>Splatoon is, quite possibly, the most Nintendo game Nintendo have ever made. It''s a combination of both their best and their worst traits, and it all culminates in the most unique shooter that I have ever played.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s start with the good - as is the case with pretty much every Nintendo game, the core gameplay is fluid, polished, and most importantly, a hell of a lot of fun. There''s something very satisfying about painting a skate park with an enormous paint roller and then squashing people who get in your way, and all of the weapons have their own benefits and quirks that make them worth trying out at least once. So many online shooters make it frustrating for new players because all the higher level players have the better weapons, but in Splatoon they''re much more balanced, largely due to the variety of specials and subweapons each weapon has available. Even the starter weapon has some viability, so you don''t feel unfairly punished by the game just for being new.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>And once you''re into it, by jove it is hard to stop! At 3 minutes, the Turf War matches are a perfect length to just dive in and have a quick couple of rounds, but then before you know it it''s 1am and you have work the next day. The "Just one more go" factor is strong.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Miiverse is handled better in this game than any other to date. In addition to seeing murals people have drawn around the battle arenas, the plaza feels like what the Wii U menu plaza should be like - you can wander around and see what each individual character has posted, and when you "Yeah!" a post, it doesn''t pause the game for 20 seconds as it sends it, it just does it in the background - like, you know, it logically should always do.</span></p><p></p><p><span>And then, Nintendo do what they always do - get pissed and haphazardly throw together an online system that decides whether or not it wants to work based on the position of Halley''s Comet relative to Alpha&nbsp;Centurai&nbsp;and throws back randomly generated error codes that ultimately mean "Shit, something went wrong. Dunno what. Try again now, it''ll work this time, we promise." If you''re connected, the server tends to work fine, but on more than one occasion I''ve been disconnected with 10 seconds to go with around 800p to my name, and lost those valuable points. Salt doesn''t even begin to describe it. There''s also no voice chat, which I personally couldn''t care less about - in fact I welcome not being sworn at by edgy 13-year-olds - but the edgy 13-year-olds on the Internet are up in arms about it. And it probably should be an option, at the very least, for a team-based shooter. And why do I have to quit out of the lobby to change which weapon I''m using? It''s a minor detail but one that can be very frustrating when you don''t like your weapon, but you do like the people you''re playing with.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Even worse is the lack of a proper offline multiplayer mode. This is something that Nintendo normally do so well; so many parties have had Smash, Mario Kart, Wii Sports,&nbsp;Nintendoland&nbsp;and many more at their heart that it seems silly that Splatoon can''t join their ranks. The Battle Dojo is disappointing, to say the least - but not as disappointing as the fact that this is the only time you can use the gamepad for Off-TV Play, which is one of my&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;Wii U features.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Almost every review has also focused on the lack of content, which is definitely an issue. The single player mode, while fun, feels like it was tacked on as an afterthought and plays second string to the online. Although Turf War is fun enough to keep the game going on its own, two modes and six stages aren''t (and what''s the deal with only being able to play two stages per mode at a time!?!?&nbsp;</span><span>All I want is to be able to choose from ALL stages when I go into a match. Why not have the same voting system that MK8 has?</span><span>) and it''s easy to see why some people may find it difficult to justify the £35 price tag.

If you don''t like that, turn back. It will also contain book spoilers. Might I interest you in some <a href="http://www.declantyson.net/pages/film-and-tv">other TV waffle?</a></strong></p><p></p><p><span>Well. That was interesting.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>I mentioned that last season of Game of Thrones was contentious for changing the source material. I now&nbsp;realise&nbsp;that I was nothing but a sweet summer child, blissfully unaware of what was to come.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>And in truth, I didn''t like it.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Some changes needed to be made, of course. A Feast For Crows was a slow-burning book, and the chronological knot between it and A Dance With Dragons meant that difficulties were bound to occur when transferring it to the screen. But they did not need to be as drastic as they were.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Some made sense. Bronn accompanying Jaime on his quest over Ilyn Payne, both due to Wilko Johnson''s health and because although conversation with a mute works on paper, it may not make the most thrilling television. The excitement furthered when we were due to see Dorne and its prince, but alas, the whole storyline was completely butchered. Instead of the sand snakes cutting Myrcella''s face, D&amp;D decided to jump straight to death, which they seem increasingly eager to do - more on that later - and it seems the Dornish plot to get a Targaryen on the iron throne has been completely cut, so Doran Martell has gone from strategic mastermind in the guise of a weak, fearful coward to just a weak, fearful coward. Where is our justice? Our vengeance? Our fire and blood?</span></p><p></p><p><span>Going back to death. The series is well known for its brutal lack of remorse in killing off its major characters, but when you do so at such a high rate, it starts to lose the effect. Barristan, for example. There was no reason for him to die, save for shock value. Nearly every major death in the books serves the plot. Barristan''s does not. Even more so is Mance Rayder''s seemingly real death. There is a huge chunk of story completely and utterly removed by this death, and the show suffers for it.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Sansa being married off to and raped by the twisted Ramsay Bolton was done purely for shock value, where she should instead be starting to grow into herself as a more well-rounded, strong adult.&nbsp;</span><span>And furthermore, what in the ever-living fuck is their obsession with Ramsay Bolton? They''ve made him appear to be some kind of strategic mastermind. Last season, he defeated an entire army of ironborn merely shirtless and with a few dogs. This season, he''s taken down the entire army of the most celebrated general in Westeros history, Stannis Baratheon (who,&nbsp;</span><span>in a complete reversal of character</span><span>, has suddenly decided to burn his own daughter).&nbsp;</span><span>I feel that when the Winds of Winter comes around, Stannis may well lose his battle for Winterfell, but the way the show uncompromisingly praises a character who is supposed to be nothing more than a cruel maniac is a little disconcerting.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ultimately, though, the biggest problem with the season is the pacing. It rushes through a hundred different storylines that took the best part of two whole books to unfold, and whilst admittedly both Feast and Dance included a lot of drivelly waffle that could have been cut, they have reduced the content by far too much. I feel at the very least that considering they have now reached the ends of Dance and indeed started the Winds of Winter in parts of the story, they probably should at least have kept Bran''s story in, and the Iron islanders - basically, there''s a hell of a lot missing.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Let''s round up with the positives, though, because there were many - the new battle at Hardhome was nothing short of epic, and Cersei''s walk of shame was handled magnificently... as was the reveal of ''Ser Robert Strong'', aka The Mountain, aka CLEGANEBOWL GET HYPE. They did Arya''s storyline justice and it made more sense for her to kill Meryn Trant as opposed to a random deserter from the Night''s Watch for her to lose her sight. The House of Black and White is more awe-inspiring than I had imagined and Arya''s story feels like it''s exactly where it should be, unlike the rest of the cast. Seeing Valyria was also incredible, even if it was short lived.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Really though, I now just want the Winds of Winter. Next season will overtake the books by some distance and I would rather read Martin''s untouched version before I watch the one that HBO are slowly pulling apart. I didn''t think I would be such a book purist, but it seems that perhaps I am.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Also, WHERE THE FUCK IS STONEHEART</span></p><p></p>

Don''t get me wrong - I have no actual issues with <i>Life Turns Electric</i> or <i>Them vs. You vs. Me</i>, but the significant change in direction leads to a lot of inconsistency outside of singles&nbsp;<i>Paralyzer </i>and <i>Living in a Dream</i>.</p><p>They''ve changed their style once more with the release of <i>Five Crooked Lines</i>, but it is a significantly more impressive change. The entire album is harder but it is also very experimental, drawing on a lot of different influences from nu-metal to prog rock. Each and every track is unique from the other, and very little of it feels like filler.&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately kicking into top gear with<i> Gods of Speed</i>, you could be forgiven for thinking you were listening to a different band and it''s not until Scott Anderson''s distinctive vocals kick in that it''s confirmed. The high-bass,&nbsp;industrialised&nbsp;guitar style continues in the fantastic <i>Criminal</i>, which sounds like it draws inspiration from contemporary rock bands like the Black Keys. This is directly contrasted to the following track, <i>Save Your Breath</i>, which sounds like it could be written by Saliva or Sevendust at the turn of the century.</p><p>Then there''s <i>Wolves and Doors</i>, which sounds more like ''traditional'' Finger Eleven - and by that I mean the funk-fused stuff that''s come off of their last two albums, not the better stuff from their self-titled and before. Their first single and clearly meant to be their flagship track, it''s OK, but it''s no <i>Paralyzer</i>, and it''s one of the weaker tracks on the album, so it''s disappointing to advertise what is a high-quality album with a track that''s a little&nbsp;lacklustre.</p><p>Fortunately, it''s immediately followed by <i>Come On, Oblivion</i> - which couldn''t be more Pink Floydian if it tried. The reverb and soft bass echo something you''d find on The Wall, but it''s broken intermittently with the classical rock chorus. And then my personal&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;track on the album follows it:<i> Not Going To Be Afraid</i>. I will admit it is a little bit of a generic ballad but it hits a note similar to some of my&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;early-2000s alt rock bands such as Cold and Staind. The title track is a similar story, but by this point the album has peaked and the second half is&nbsp;noticably&nbsp;weaker.</p><p>That''s not to say it''s bad - I''m still not convinced <i>Blackout Song</i> isn''t written by Weezer, and it''s great. <i>Absolute Truth, Lost For Words</i> and <i>Sensory Eraser</i> are all good tracks too, they''re just not as good as what''s on offer in the first half. The album closes out with <i>A New Forever</i>, which carries the style of some of <i>Them vs. You vs. Me</i>''s slower songs, and it''s a strong example of what those albums did do well.</p><p>My only real&nbsp;disppointment&nbsp;is that despite all their experimentation and throwbacks, they didn''t include a classic alt rock track in the style of <i>Good Times</i> or <i>Stay in Shadow</i>. So as much as I love this album, for me the band will still be at their best in 2003 on the <i>1080<b>°</b> Avalanche</i> soundtrack.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

What was once a lightweight, flexible browser has become extremely bloated and has various intricacies that cause development frustration; be it the inconsistency of letting you turn breakpoints off or hidden-away features like smooth-scrolling and video hardware acceleration that are turned off by default, but make websites so much better. And let''s not mention the awful handling of web fonts.</span></p><p></p><p><span>For the average user this matters little, except the first point: Chrome is no longer the sprinter it used to be. It''s partially to be expected with the evolution of the browser and perhaps more importantly the web itself - resource-intensive web applications are becoming more and more prominent - but that doesn''t really justify&nbsp;Chrome eating RAM so readily.</span></p><p></p><p><span>So Microsoft have a perfect opportunity to come in here and enter a market at the weakest point for some time, with a brand-new, from the ground-up browser that&nbsp;ditches the entire Internet Explorer name and the stigma that goes along with it. And yet, they fall at the first hurdle.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Before I even get into the browser itself, I want to have a rant about Microsoft''s increasingly shitty branding ideas. If the Xbox One wasn''t named poorly enough, Windows 10 is even worse. Their logic behind the name is to move away from the poor reception of Windows 8, which is fair, but by skipping number 9 all they did was draw even more attention to it.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, in the grand scheme of things it''s irrelevant, but it doesn''t stop it being stupid. But even that isn''t as stupid as building an excellent new browser to get away from one that''s got a terrible reputation but then forgetting to change the fucking icon.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Windows 10 (and indeed, every windows version since 7) is heavily icon-based. Your active applications are icons only, and the start menu icons are much more readily available than the text. The vast, vast majority of Windows users are not interested in the intricacies of how anything works, as long as it does. Now, all but those who are not regular computer users have come to the point where they understand what an Internet browser is, and that there are other (better) options available than Internet Explorer. So when they see that big blue E, one of two things will happen:&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><i><b>Computer-illiterate user:</b> ''That big blue E is the Internet.''<br></i><i style="line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"><b>Average user: </b>''Eurgh, Internet Explorer. I hate that. I guess I''ll use it to download Chrome/Firefox/Safari.''</i></p><p></p><p><span>TL;DR: Keeping the E icon may keep your more timid users happy, but you still have Internet Explorer for that - you could push them to that, rather than wasting your new product on an audience that won''t understand or appreciate the changes. The majority of people are going to see that icon, not give a shit that it''s named anything different, assume it''s the same as the IE that they have bad preconceptions of and - bang - there goes 90% of your potential&nbsp;userbase.</span></p><p></p><p><span>As for the other 10% that care enough to delve into it, there''s more to offer, but not enough.</span></p><p><span>The overall experience of Edge is pleasant. It''s quick, lightweight - almost barebones, in fact - and is probably the best&nbsp;</span><span>aesthetically&nbsp;of any desktop browser currently available.</span><span>But the lack of add-ons and no sign of them incoming is a big downfall, as the in-built features are lacking.&nbsp;</span><span>Cortana integration is neat, and beautifully presented, but it''s a gimmick, just like Google Now. Similarly is the ability to draw on a webpage, which situationally could be useful but is pretty clearly - like much of Microsoft''s products these days - dreamt up with the Surface in mind. The dev tools are functional but basic.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Microsoft has missed an opportunity here to score a big chunk of the browser share with a semi-decent browser but silly oversights have cost them. It''s unbelievably frustrating as they are such simple mistakes and they lie mostly at the branding as opposed to the actual software itself. Somebody get them a new branding team, before they call the next version of Windows ''Millenium Edition:2''.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

We steer dangerously close to Roger Moore eyebrow-waggling when Bond lands on a sofa after falling nine stories but fortunately it''s handled well by Craig who is now so comfortable in the Bond role that his cufflink adjustments almost feel as if they are part of Fleming''s lore.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Dave Bautista plays a competent if unremarkable henchman in Mr. Hinx (whose name I''m not actually sure was mentioned in the film, someone feel free to correct me if I''m wrong) and leads to some fantastic sequences like the train fight that does&nbsp;</span><span>From Russia With Love</span><span>&nbsp;proud. Sam Mendes has also been watching&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</span><span>for the eye-gouging scene, it would seem. Hinx''s death, however, is a little anticlimactic and the shadows of&nbsp;</span><span>Die Another Day''s&nbsp;</span><span>American crudeness comes across in his final line of ''shit'' - reminding us all that Bautista, whilst delivering an outstanding physical performance, is a much better actor when he''s not speaking.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The chase in the beautiful Aston Martin DB10 is great too, and Craig delivers the witty one-liners much better than he has done in previous iterations. Really, despite his outspoken hatred for the character right now, Craig is the glue that holds&nbsp;</span><span>SPECTRE&nbsp;</span><span>together.</span></p><p></p><p><span>But Craig isn''t the only performance that stands out: Léa Seydoux brings depth to a well-written Bond girl (unlike the wasted and really rather pointless appearance of Monica Bellucci), and then of course we come to Christopher Waltz, who - in the least shocking reveal of all time - turns out to be Blofeld and will go down as the best performance from any actor to play the legendary supervillain. The scar he displays after Bond bombs the desert bunker is also a very nice touch. Unfortunately, and through no fault of&nbsp;Watlz''s, it''s in Blofeld that the film''s key problems lie.</span></p><p></p><h3><span>And the worst bit?</span></h3><p></p><p><span>It was barely a secret that Waltz would be playing Blofeld. As soon as the title of the film was revealed it was pretty obvious that the cat-stroking maniac would be in it, and the ''twist'' that Franz Oberhauser is really Blofeld feels extremely forced, shoehorned in for the sake of a big reveal. And it detracts from the character who is supposed to be a criminal mastermind at the head of the world''s most successful criminal&nbsp;organisation, instead turning his motive into one of (extremely) petty revenge because his father liked James Bond.</span></p><p></p><p><span>It doesn''t help that the first time we are properly introduced to Waltz as more than just a shadow at the head of a table he is wearing the distinctive&nbsp;grey&nbsp;Nehru jacket and within 10 minutes there''s already a white cat. It''s not really much of a twist if we know within the first second of meeting him who he really is. I feel that the Oberhauser bullshit should just have been dropped and just gone with Blofeld to begin with - and honestly, given him a more important role.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Part of Blofeld''s charm was that before we saw him for real we had four films of build up of this intimidating, hidden figure - whereas in&nbsp;</span><span>SPECTRE</span><span>we get a solitary 10 minutes. Obviously, four films of build-up is not possible right now, but at least some of the film''s focus should be moved away from the Snowden-esque commentary and onto building up the film''s antagonist.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Touching further on the comment I made earlier about Monica Bellucci''s appearance - when the casting was announced it was hailed as a brilliant move for older women in the industry, but upon actually watching what they''ve done with her character it''s simply embarrassing. Her husband is murdered by Bond, which - for some seemingly inexplicable reason - makes her a target for hitmen. Bond protects her from them and then proceeds to seduce her in the most rapey manner he possibly can, before taking off and never mentioning her again. It''s even worse than Severine in&nbsp;</span><span>Skyfall,&nbsp;</span><span>at least your learnt of her fate before completely forgetting about her</span><span>.</span></p><p></p><p><span>However, having said all of that, when you''re watching&nbsp;</span><span>SPECTRE</span><span>&nbsp;these things matter little. I was incredibly entertained throughout and it wasn''t until after the film had ended and I had time to reflect on what I had witnessed that I&nbsp;realised&nbsp;the grievances I had. Taking&nbsp;</span><span>SPECTRE</span><span>&nbsp;for what it is - a Bond film in the style of old, mindless escapism as opposed to the high-end cinema that was brought in&nbsp;</span><span>Casino Royale</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Skyfall</span><span>, it''s a great film. Not the best, but very, very far from the worst.</span></p><p></p><h3><span>What about the theme tune?</span></h3><p></p><p><span>A friend once described Sam Smith''s voice as ''trying to sing with a mouthful of peanut butter'', and that phrase has stuck with me ever since. The thing is,&nbsp;</span><span>Writing''s On The Wall&nbsp;</span><span>itself isn''t bad. It starts off solidly enough, but then it carries on building up, and reaches a point where there should be an explosive climax - but the climax never arrives. Basically, it''s a weaker version of Adele''s Skyfall, which was hardly the strongest entry ever.</span></p><p></p><h3><span>And so, the updated ranking</span></h3><p><span>24. Die Another Day<br>23. Quantum of Solace<br>22. Thunderball<br>21. Moonraker<br>20. A View To A Kill<br>19. Diamonds Are Forever<br>18. Octopussy<br>17. The Man With The Golden Gun<br>16. For Your Eyes Only<br>15.

In fact, it''s a very good and very enjoyable film.

The special effects still hold up weirdly well almost 40 years later and it manages to tell a story exceptionally well.

He sees a lot of himself (and possibly Luke) in Rey, and after his - shall we say difficult - relationship with his son he wants someone else to follow after him.&nbsp;</span><span>These paternal relationship difficulties manifest in the form of a Sith&nbsp;lord who would rather be like dear old Grandpa Vader than his actual father.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Due to the fact that&nbsp;</span><span>The Force Awakens</span><span>&nbsp;is basically a remake of</span><span>&nbsp;A New Hope</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>It''s sensationally obvious within the first hour, like Obi Wan before him,&nbsp;</span><span>Solo will die, tragically, at the hands of the villain of the piece.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>That being said, I''m a big fan of Kylo Ren in general. So much is made of the dark side being full of anger, hate, and fear, but although young Anakin shows this, Darth Vader is in fact a pretty chill guy for the most part. He gets mildly annoyed sometimes and his punishments of choking people may be a tad harsh, but he keeps it in control. Ren gets truly fucking pissed. He is almost a petulant child, but it''s a side of the Sith that hasn''t really been seen often enough. He has inner struggles before killing his father and is clearly a much more complex character than just ''evil''. The&nbsp;emperor''s&nbsp;replacement,&nbsp;Snoke, is currently a bit of an enigma, which is promising for the continuation of the series.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ignoring the fact that the film essentially spoils itself, the train of nostalgia is ridden a little too far throughout, which is a crying shame because both Rey and Finn are&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;well-written and performed by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega.&nbsp;</span><span>Perhaps it is just impossible for this film to live up to the insane hype that it has received and I''ll enjoy it more on further watches but I don''t think it was better than any of the original trilogy. And I''m not sure, but I might even prefer Sith. ''Better than The Phantom Menace and Clones'' doesn''t sound very good, in my head.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Anyway, I digress. I''m glad Han Solo is gone, because now we can focus on the new characters without being held back by the 73-year old trying to squeeze every penny out of the franchise before he dies.&nbsp;I''m looking forward to seeing the new characters build further, especially under the training of Yoda - I mean, Luke.</span></p><p></p>

I mean, I know I''ve been really, really crap with writing blogs lately, but that doesn''t change the fact that not only have I not really had time to play videogames much in the past year, there''s not really been anything that''s grabbed my attention enough to warrant writing about.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Fallout 4&nbsp;</span><span>was great, but more of the same, while&nbsp;</span><span>Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain</span><span>&nbsp;had interesting gameplay but a pretty below-par story that left me disappointed.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Undertale</span><span>had been recommended to me several times before I actually got around to playing it for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but it took a while for me to really understand what the game was about. It doesn''t market itself very well – the art style is a little trite in the Steam screenshots and, as pixel art goes, it''s not the best. Granted, it''s supposed to be a little bit of a throwback to&nbsp;</span><span>Earthbound -</span><span>&nbsp;a comparison that becomes ever more&nbsp;prevelant&nbsp;as you begin to play – but on the surface, it''s not very pretty.</span></p><p></p><p><span>On reflection this was totally unfair for me to judge as there are sequences in the game which use some very nice effects and are nothing short of beautiful. And although it isn''t immediately obvious what the game is about, it''s because it''s probably the freshest, most unique RPG for quite some time.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The battle system is nothing short of genius. Bullet hell is not a genre you''d expect to see in an RPG but it works incredibly well and honestly I can see variations becoming more common. Every single enemy battle is unique, with different obstacles and actions for victory, and this is where the&nbsp;</span><span>Earthbound</span><span>&nbsp;comparisons inevitably begin. Like&nbsp;ShigesatoItoi''s&nbsp;timeless masterpiece, there''s a sense of humour, charm, humility and sadness that strikes through the very core of&nbsp;</span><span>Undertale</span><span>, and there are very few – if any – other games that truly make you feel guilty for killing your enemies instead of sparing them, and this is largely due to the unique personalities of each monster that have been so carefully crafted – from the pun-cracking skeleton Sans to the motherly&nbsp;Toriel&nbsp;and everyone in between.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>At a base level, the story isn''t that original – a human gets trapped in a world of monsters and has to make his way out – but the deep lore and t</span><span>he sheer amount of thought and creativity that has gone into making the world so charming is incredible, and although the main story is fairly short at only around 5 hours long, the various decisions, challenging nature and fun boss battles provide enough content for multiple&nbsp;playthroughs. The game remembers every single decision or action you take, even if you die or reset, which really helps immerse you into the world like few other games do, and the final boss is hilarious, terrifying and satisfying all at the same time.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Undertale</span><span>&nbsp;is more than just an&nbsp;</span><span>Earthbound</span><span>-inspired RPG, it''s a reinvention of the genre as a whole and a message to the whole industry: people don''t want the same old crap. As the phenomenal success of this game proves, people want something fresh, original, something that makes them think.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I am revisiting my game of the year for 2015 –&nbsp;</span><span>Fallout 4</span><span>&nbsp;has fallen, but&nbsp;</span><span>Undertale</span><span>&nbsp;is rightfully deserving of its place.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', NULL, NULL, '20160321 12:33:26', '20160321 12:33:26', 1, 1)

Chaos is an ever-present in my life these days, but - even though I have said it several hundred times before - I will endeavour to improve my output in terms of writing a blog.</p><p>So, here''s a start. Rather than delve on a specific topic, I''m going to have a ramble - or rather, a brianfart - for a while on the general state of me, and of the world.</p><p>Back in June, I left Howoco after four years. It was an emotional decision, but it was one that had to be made. Now I''m working with e2y - a digital e-commerce company specialising in Hybris. It''s going well, and it''s good to be around so many talented programmers with whom I can both teach and learn from.</p><p>Leicester City won the fucking league - I still can''t quite grasp it. Sensational stuff. I''m not going to bother doing the whole Best XI blog from last season, but just for posterity, here''s the list: <i>Schmeichel, Alderweireld, Smalling, Morgan, Rose, Kante, Mahrez, Payet, Alli, Vardy, Kane.</i></p><p>Of course, the superb performances of English players gave me far too much hope going into France into 2016. I defended Hodgson for a while but his tactical obstinance and refusal to make the changes that even a football newbie could see would help break open the defences of Russia and Wales made him outstay his welcome even in my forgiving eyes. You know, I could even have forgiven losing to Iceland if we hadn''t play so absolutely awfully - it was, without question, the worst performance I have ever seen from an England side, and that''s saying rather a lot.</p><p><b>Begin Game of Thrones spoilers</b></p><p>Season 6 was such a massive, massive improvement on the previous two, and I don''t think it''s just because of the major plot points. It felt much more well-paced and written. The Door is probably the most emotional episode of television I''ve ever watched - who knew that you could get so attached to a minor character? Plus of course the return of the Hound opens the door for Cleganebowl, even if it won''t be at Cersei''s trial - the coldsteel bitch. And then, finally, we have confirmation of R+L=J - and now we just need to wait for Jon to realise, and the effects it will have on Westeros.</p><p><b>End Game of Thrones spoilers</b></p><p>Oh, and Stranger Things! What a series - incredibly well written and acted by all involved. Netflix it now if you haven''t already. I love how it wraps up everything by the end of the series - but opens up some new questions for season 2. It seems that 12-13 episodes is the perfect length for a TV series, as there''s no filler, but nothing is rushed. Really, really good stuff.</p><p>DC''s Cinematic Universe certainly isn''t going as well as Marvel''s. Civil War was a sensational success, and with good reason. In the meantime, I didn''t even bother with Batman vs Superman because Man of Steel was one of the worst things I''ve ever watched, and Suicide Squad was... entertaining enough, but you could feel that it suffered from heavy-handed studio editing, and although I did enjoy it, it''s very easy to see why it received such negative attention.</p><p>Biffy Clyro''s new album Ellipsis is a bit of a mixed bag, in my mind, which is a shame, because Opposites was absolutely fantastic - I suppose it was always going to be a let down following that, though. That said, Bastille seem to have followed up the incredible Bad Blood very well so far - if the rest of the album is even close to the quality of Good Grief, I''ll be a very happy man.</p><p>I got a PlayStation 4 at last - it''s a very neat bit of kit. You can talk all you like about PC Master Race bullshit, but at the end of the day software is what sells me a system, and I want to play Uncharted, Little Big Planet, and more. I''ve also been getting into No Man''s Sky, which I thought looked great at E3 2014 - but there''s enough content there for a blog, which I''ll write soon. Hopefully a little faster than GRRM writes The Winds of Winter.</p><p>And finally, me and my wonderful fiancée have been alphabet dating - including Alpaca walking, Climbing, Fudge making, and Horse riding down in beautiful Cornwall. It''s a great concept and I''d recommend it to anyone who needs an idea of something different to do.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;">And so, brainfart over. I''ve stretched my fingers writing text instead of code for twenty minutes, so hopefully I can get into a bit more again. DT out.</span><br></p>

	<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100"><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p></p><p><span>An awful lot has already been written about Hello Games'' procedurally generated sandbox game, and with very good reason. It''s proved to be extremely divisive due to a fairly extreme case of&nbsp;Molyneuxism. It is, in a sense, a victim of it''s own marketing success – without the huge build up, unrealistic promises and constant media focus, No Man''s Sky would undoubtedly have been accepted as a brilliant hidden indie gem.</span></p><p></p><p><span>There seems to be a very distinct lack of middle ground on the debate. One the one side there is nothing but hate and vitriol, and on the other, blinding praise and love. But is it really deserving of either?</span></p><p></p><p><span>I had the advantage of coming into No Man''s Sky without following the build up too closely. As a result, I went into the game expecting exactly what I got – a chilled out sandbox game with a stupid amount to explore, perfect for winding down after a long day, when sometimes competitive gaming just stresses me out more. It''s an incredibly therapeutic experience – and I think that''s the thing here, you have to think of it as less of a game, and more of an experience.</span></p><p></p><p><span>That being said, had I bought the game for what it was promised to be in the months leading up to release I would be pretty furious – even now the trailer on the Steam page for the game could surely be tantamount to fraud. But, I''m not going to focus my thoughts right now on what Hello Games said would or wouldn''t be an option – I''m going to talk about the game in its current state, and how it can be improved.</span></p><p></p><p><span>What we have, is a blueprint for potentially the best game ever. The procedural generation – in terms of creating realistic planets – is absolutely&nbsp;mindblowing. In my mind, you could take this algorithm and build almost any genre of game on top of it. Although a sci-fi MMO is the most obvious, I think it would be awesome if you could play stupidly large Civilization-inspired strategy games.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Following this train of thought, I''ve been thinking about what my ultimate game would be. It would be a hybrid of NMS, Age of Empires, Dungeon Keeper, Civilization and SimCity – hear me out.</span></p><p></p><p><span>You have a procedurally generated galaxy. You start at the bottom of a tech tree in a similar vein to&nbsp;Civ, with nothing but a town centre, like AOE. In real time, you create units – workers,&nbsp;soliders, etc. These can be instructed to build and maintain improvements, like&nbsp;Civ, but the actual improvements are closer to that of SimCity – so you have to maintain a city''s water, housing and food supply, power later in the game, and so on and so forth. Most of the game would be played in a top-down style view, but you can take control over one of your unit''s in DK&nbsp;posession-style to get things done more quickly or give your combat units a bonus. This would let you see your creations in a first person view.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>But I digress. No Man''s Sky is none of these things and I don''t expect it to be. However there does need to be something else to do - you have a huge amount of planets to explore but apart from mine minerals and try to upgrade your ship there''s not much else. It does get quite repetitive quickly. The Base building update they have announced is a good start but in that case they need a better way to travel to planets you have previously visited so you can designate a planet to be your home.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>I''d also like to see a view more objectives in the sandbox mode - nothing major, but it would be good if you had to hunt down and destroy cargo ships for the&nbsp;Vy''keen, or go and research a particular species of animal and return findings to the&nbsp;Korvax. Hell, even some basic mineral fetch quests would be good - you enter a galaxy and go into a space station, meet the alien there and he says "gib&nbsp;Iridium" or something and then you have to scour the systems planets until you find some.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>This only works if the rewards are good too, though. Right now you can only really spend gold on buying ships and multitools. What if you could build your own ship and buy individual parts? That''d be neat. And then when Base building comes in you could get building blueprints as rewards for quests.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Another problems is that the factions are utterly pointless. The&nbsp;Gek,&nbsp;Korvax&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vy''keen&nbsp;never really come into contact with one another, and being on good terms with any of them doesn''t much effect on anything - and being on bad terms is next to impossible, so I don''t know what would happen, but I''m assuming they continue to sit in their chair doing nothing. Why no communication between them? Why no consequences?&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>All that said, I do very much like No Man''s Sky. It definitely hasn''t lived up to its potential, let alone any promises, but it''s still an interesting, fun and relaxing way to kill an hour or two, exploring one planet at a time before moving on to the next one. I''m quite happy to take it slowly, so I don''t feel like I''m going to get burnt out any time soon, especially if they do carry on with the free updates.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>I suppose the golden question is: is it worth the £50 price tag? I suppose that depends on your definition of worth - for me, I have already got 25+ hours out of it, so for £2/hour, yes I feel I have my money''s worth. But if you''re stricter with your ideals and you want more content for your money then you''re best off going somewhere else because the game is as wide as an ocean but as shallow as a puddle.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>', N'Gaming', NULL, NULL, '20160907 23:41:44', '20160907 23:41:44', 1, 1)

Heavy metal/metalcore had long been my music of choice, but I was starting to move away from that somewhat into the rather hipster world of indietronica, where bands replace vowels with the letter V and begin their songs with samples of niche 70''s B-movies. Hearing&nbsp;<i>Pompeii</i>&nbsp;was the catalyst, really, for my music taste to shift further to the electropop spectrum. Although I do still listen to metal regularly, it''s not really the majority of what I listen to anymore.</p><p><i>Bad Blood</i>&nbsp;was my&nbsp;<a href="http://declantyson.net/awards">album of the year for 2013</a>, and to be honest it''s not really been bettered since then. It''s an album I find myself putting back on regularly, so I was very excited for the follow-up.&nbsp;What I got wasn''t as strong as the first album, and on first listen through I was even a little disappointed, but I''ve grown to love it with a few more playthroughs. There''s definitely a bit of a polarity between songs I enjoy and songs I don''t so much, though - and it''s almost invariably the slow songs that are weaker.</p><p>Lead single&nbsp;<i>Good Grief</i>&nbsp;follows the formula of&nbsp;<i>Pompeii,&nbsp;</i>by disguising what are actually very downbeat lyrics with a catchy, upbeat tempo. It''s not quite as dark as ash-ridden corpses, but it''s still ultimately a sad song about the death of a loved one and trying to come to terms with grief - even putting a positive spin on it. Quite literally, good grief.</p><p>There''s heavy use of distorted bass throughout the whole album, and it works pretty well, giving it a unique sound -&nbsp;<i>The Currents</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Warmth,&nbsp;</i>two of my favourite songs on the record, both display this very well.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem definitely arrives when they try to go more ballad-y - I''m really not a fan of&nbsp;<i>An Act of Kindness</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Two Evils</i>, although I can''t quite put my finger on why. It''s not that Dan Smith''s voice isn''t suited to that type of singing, but it''s just better suited at the more pop-orientated tracks. The main problem is that the whole of&nbsp;<i>Wild World</i>&nbsp;is a bit slower-paced than&nbsp;<i>Bad Blood&nbsp;</i>- which means there''s less of it I enjoy.</p><p><i>Send Them Off!</i>&nbsp;is probably my favourite song this time out, which starts with a sample ("It was a slight on my honour, so he deserved it... but we''re talking about the most brilliant mind this world has ever seen!") from apparently terrible Italian 70''s sci-fi flick&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149677/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Cosmos: War of the Planets</a>&nbsp;- and like I said, this is basically what my music taste has become.</p><p><i>Wild World</i>&nbsp;won''t have as much of an impact on my personal music taste as&nbsp;<i>Bad Blood</i>&nbsp;did, but I''m already finding myself putting it on quite often. I don''t love it in the same way, but it''s going to keep me happy for a while - and with a wide variety of remixes coming out seemingly every day, it''s going to have a fair bit of longevity.</p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

		<div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p></p><p><span>In my reviews of the previous waves of&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games, I wrote them to match the lyrics of songs about Streets. I''m still not entirely sure why, but it happened.</span></p><p></p><p><span>To the relief of near enough everybody, I won''t be doing that again. The reason of this is twofold: firstly, I can''t be bothered to think of a third song well-known enough for the joke to work, but the second reason is much sadder -&nbsp;</span><span>I think&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;is dying, and I feel that theming this blog with song lyrics won''t quite capture the tone of disappointment I want to show you.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The Nintendo 3DS is possibly my favourite console I''ve ever owned, with an incredible catalogue of games and a ton of features, with StreetPass being one of the best. But over the past 6-12 months new releases have dwindled, with very little outside of Fire Emblem: Fates being really notable, and as such, my&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;hits have taken a massive tumble. Living in Central London, I was getting 10 hits a day this time last year, but since the release of the new games about a month ago, I''ve had a grand total of 23. &nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>As a result, I''ve found it difficult to actually play the games to review them properly. Play coins are all well and good but it doesn''t really give you enough to go off when you only get a maximum of 5 wanderers/mercs&nbsp;a day. You need more than 1 for most of the games to be&nbsp;worthwhile&nbsp;at all.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I''ve finally managed to play them enough to get a decent enough impression for you, so here is a very brief rundown.</span></p><p></p><p><span>StreetPass&nbsp;Racer</span><span>&nbsp;is a fun little chaos-ridden app, with possibly the highest skill requirement of all of the new ones. That being said, very little skill is actually required outside of learning the timing. I feel like it could have been excellent if they''d actually tried to put any&nbsp;semblence&nbsp;of depth into it, but they haven’t. I think rather than going the&nbsp;Scalextric&nbsp;route, it would have been much more fun as a (still very simple) Micro Machines-style racer. Just add turning, and the game would be a lot better.</span></p><p></p><p><span>StreetPass&nbsp;Trader&nbsp;</span><span>is a fun little stock simulation, trading shares in the companies of the other&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games. It''s really quite simple and&nbsp;kinda&nbsp;fun – also it''s the first game in the entire suite to run at 60fps – but the actual passerby element is lacking, as ''analysts''&nbsp;make the game a bit too easy, and serve no purpose other than telling you what button to press when.</span></p><p></p><p><span>StreetPass&nbsp;Chef</span><span>&nbsp;is the surprise of the package, for me. I mean, gameplay is basically non-existent, but the setting and theming that fits so comfortably into Quest is charming. Many of the recipes don''t quite make sense, and some of the mechanics don''t really add up (I''m still not sure how to&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;make giant meals), but I kind of like it.</span></p><p></p><p><span>StreetPass&nbsp;Explorers</span><span>should be so much better than it is. The idea of other explorers passing on their steps to you to progress&nbsp;through&nbsp;a dungeon is a great one, and it could make a really cool roguelike-style game, but instead we have a completely on-rails do-nothing-and-occasionally-tranquilise-animals simulator.</span></p><p></p><p><span>StreetPass&nbsp;Ninja</span><span>&nbsp;takes the cake, though.&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;Ninja is the definition of a smartphone game, except they''ve clogged it up with quite a lot of menus that remove all of the convenience of playing a smartphone game. It''s not good.</span></p><p></p><p><span>So yeah, I''m not really happy. I always said I''d support&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;as I really like the feature and &nbsp;- with Nintendo''s foray into mobile and also the upcoming Switch - &nbsp;I think it still has a future. The thing is,&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games have always been shallow and simple, but at least you would actually feel like you were playing a game with the older ones, rather than just pressing the A button 3 times and the game being over.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I suppose a broader question is what will happen to the 3DS now, with the annoncement of the Switch? The thing is, I''m still not 100% sold on the Switch. The concept of a hybrid console is one I''ve wanted for a very long time, but after the Wii U I''m pretty worried about developer support, as well as price and battery life. If the console is a littler underpowered and can''t do 4k I can live with that – Nintendo games often look very beautiful anyway – but it will be the software that sells it to me at the end of the day, so I guess we''ll wait and see.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Nintendo seem adamant that the 3DS will continue at and beyond the launch of the Switch, and with a new&nbsp;Pokemon&nbsp;title coming next month, you can probably see why. Nintendo''s portable market – even with the 3DS''s tricky launch – has been their cash cow, so it''s a bold move to potentially conflict with their own interests.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I don''t expect to see any more&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;games, to be honest, but if they do ever come about, why hasn''t there been a TCG yet? With a battle system? In fact, why haven''t they remade the amazing&nbsp;Pokemon&nbsp;TCG for Game Boy with&nbsp;StreetPass&nbsp;features? I''m going to add that idea to the growing list of projects that I will most likely never start and certainly never finish.</span></p><p></p><p><span>I don''t really know how to end this blog, as it''s been a bit of a braindump from start to finish, not planned at all. Bye!</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

The draw of Iceland''s volcanic landscapes and arctic climate was one that we were unable to resist, a place unlike any other on Earth.</p>
<p>We booked our hotel in Reykjavik and hired a car. For the next 2 months Gabi meticulously and thoroughly planned an in-depth an accurate itinerary of the routes and stops we would make, incorporating the Golden Circle, a snowmobiling tour and even a trip further afield to the southern coast. All of this in three days, which we believed to be plenty of time.</p>
<p>After picking up the Suzuki Vitara from Keflavik airport we immediately drove to the nearby town of Grindavík to grab some much needed lunch after a sleepless night. We pulled in to the snow-covered car park of Salthusið and entered the cabin for our first taste of Icelandic hospitality. "Goðan daginn, talarþú Ensku?" I repeated from memory, praying and hoping that the answer was yes. "Yes," came the response of the hostess, almost surprised that I had even asked. I did not need to repeat the phrase again the entire time I was there. Icelandic people seem to be evolved almost a level above those in England - effortlessly polite, infinitely accommodating and their linguistic skills are flawless. It may seem to be a cliché to say that their English is better than many English people but it''s entirely true, and often without any trace of an accent.</p>
<p>After a very tasty burger we drove the short distance out of town to the Blue Lagoon, like basically every other tourist landing in Iceland that day. It''s Iceland''s equivalent of a typical tacky tourist attraction - except it''s not really tacky at all. It''s a superb introduction to the volcanic landscape of Iceland, and it''s naturally heated by geothermal energy. After a long morning travelling it was great to relax in.</p>
<p>By the time we reached Reykjavik it was dark, as it would be every time we were in the city. Before checking into the hotel we spent a good half hour driving around the streets, getting to know the city centre. We didn''t get to spend as much time as we would have liked there, but we managed to visit the Little Christmas shop and the great cathedral of Hallgrímskirkja. That first night we ate at the Bryggjan Brugghús, a microbrewery in the harbour, devouring an enormous mackerel and a 10oz steak between us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our snowmobile tour that was due to be scheduled on Thursday was postponed until Friday, due to extreme weather. No sweat, we thought, we''ll just switch the itinerary of days around. And so, we began the long drive along the south coast of Iceland towards the black sands of Vík. We were not long into our journey before we came across a viewing spot overlooking the village of Hveragerði, so we decided to stop off and watch the sun rise. It didn''t take long for us to realise why we wouldn''t be snowmobiling - we could barely stand up due to the insane wind, and little did we know that it was only due to get worse.</p>
<p>After a brief stop at Fákasel horse park, we pressed on into what would be the first of several snowstorms. Although initially terrifying, it soon became exciting; but we had to drive extremely carefully to compensate for the few feet of visibility we were granted. It was to die off occasionally, helped by the shelter of the mountains, but each time you entered flat land (which was frequent) the wind would blow the settled snow across you, causing the whole shebang to start over.</p>
<p>We arrived at Seljalandsfoss, which is pronounced differently every time I look at it. It was the first major stop that we had come across so we were excited to get the GoPro out and start filming. Classically, I fell over within twenty seconds on the sheet of ice that led up to the waterfall (fortunately, it was to be the only time). There is a hilarious video of me doing this but you''ll have to find it yourself.</p>
<p>Normally you can walk behind the waterfall there, but we decided against it due to the rather high chance that one of us would fall and either break our necks or freeze to death from the icy water below. So we spent a short time watching the waterfall, shooting footage, and playing in the snow before heading back towards the car. </p>
<p>It was at this moment where I experienced the worst terror I have ever felt in my life.</p>
<p>I slipped my gloves off and then put my hand into my left pocket. No, surely not.</p>
<p>"I haven''t got the car keys."</p>
<p>Here I was, in approximately -10° weather, 20km from the nearest town and over 150km from the car hire place to get a new key to us. And I''d lost the fucking car keys.</p>
<p>We asked at the hut, nobody had handed them in. The next 20 minutes was a panicked mess as I searched every inch in a ~30 meter radius of where I had fallen, convinced that was the only time they could possibly have fallen out of my pocket. I had no luck, and my hands were starting to die.</p>
<p>We were just about to give in and call the car hire place, but we decided to ask the coffee hut one last time, and I was saved. Somebody had handed them in. I got lucky. Somewhat ironically I bought a new keyring there - a somewhat fitting memento - and onwards we drove, as thankful as a dog at an all-you-can-eat sausage buffet. </p>
<p>Cold and tired, we stopped at a small restaurant named Gamla Fjósið to warm up with some hearty volcano soup. Hearty and warming it was indeed, but at a steep 2,390 ISK per portion it may be the most expensive soup I have ever eaten. This wasn''t the only time we were shocked at the price of things in Iceland. Working out at about 70p per 100 krona, it''s not the easiest currency to translate quickly, but I don''t think I came across anything that you could buy for less than 300 krona.</p>
<p>Poorer but much warmer, we continued our journey on to Skógafoss, which is considerably more powerful than Seljalandsfoss. Not only was the waterfall itself more powerful, but so too was the fucking wind. The weather forecast claimed that the wind was around 40mph, but I''ve experienced that level of wind in England, and let me tell you now - nothing has <em>ever</em> come close to what we experienced at Skógafoss. We were literally being pushed along the ground by the wind, it was making us run when we were trying to walk - in truth, it was absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>Due to my key-losing stupidity, it was now quite late in the day and we were running out of sunlight to see Vík in. We picked up the pace down route 1, and were fortunate enough to not get caught in any further snowstorms before we finally pulled up to Black Sand Beach as the sun was setting.</p>
<p><img src="http://declantyson.net/assets/background-images/iceland-road-trip.png"><br></p>
<p>We had actually parked around the "wrong" side of the cliffs - the famed basalt columns were only visible around the other side - but it was actually worth it to see the sun set over the beach, the end of an incredible journey.</p>
<p>And yet, the adventure had still only just begun. We drove straight back to Reykjavik, stopping only for a coffee and petrol, and managed to capture this amazing view:</p>
<p>[Video to come, please be patient!]</p>
<p>Almost three hours later, we decided that we wanted to try one of the famous Icelandic hotdogs. Served within seconds, we ate them even faster. They''re like frankfurters, except much, much, nicer. So nice, that we went back for a second one and ruined our dinner plans by eating too much.</p>
<p>Too much food be damned, though, we pressed on to the Sea Baron, which we had researched thoroughly before we flew out. To begin with we had the lobster soup, which was delicious and full of meat and vegetables. I tried a sample of minke whale - controversial maybe, but I''m not going to discuss that here. It was OK - it tasted like very rich beef and quite metallic. I would not want to eat a full meal of it. However, the monkfish and pepper skewers were absolutely delicious. </p>
<p>No travel blog would be complete without an idiotic tourist mistake (not including the key incident). We arrived back to the car and drove back to the hotel, but I could see a flickering piece of paper underneath the windscreen wiper. Turns out the car - which we thought was parked completely legally - now had a 10000 ISK parking ticket attached to it. We looked at eachother, perplexed. There were other cars parked on the same stretch of road as us. There was no indication we couldn''t park there at all. It turns out that unlike in the UK, Reykjavik car parking is whitelisted and not blacklisted - you have to be explicitly allowed to park somewhere, as opposed to having to avoid double yellow lines/signs informing you that you cannot stop.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it did not spoil what was one of the best days of my life. The sense of adrenaline and adventure I was experiencing was only enhanced by the disasters of the day, and I went to bed that night extremely tired but happier than I have felt in a very long time.</p>
<p>And that was just day two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our snowmobiling tour was not meant to be, cancelled again for the Friday. We continued on with our plan unperturbed, and after stopping at a local bank to pay the parking ticket, we drove off to explore the Golden Circle. The wind had not let up since the day before, and by the time we arrived at Þingvellir national park the wind chill had brought the temperature down to a staggering -12°. We walked through the trees and forests and made our way over to Silfra, where the continental plates of Eurasia and North America meet, just another fascinating place in this country so full of them.</p>
<p>Rather than spend a fortune on lunch we got another hot dog, shortly before we arrived at Geysir. Seeing a geyser has for a long time been quite high up on my bucket list, but one thing I hadn''t considered was the stench of sulphur that would come with it. We stayed there about 45 minutes and saw four eruptions, impressive but quickly swept away by the gales. </p>
<p>Our final stop on the Golden Circle was Gulfoss. The most famous of Iceland''s waterfalls, it''s difficult to capture in photos just how large and breathtaking it is - it could easily be the setting for a Tolkien story, and every time you looked at it you would see something new and beautiful. We could easily have stayed there and watched it all day.</p>
<p>But it was our anniversary that day, and we had booked a table at Grillmarkaðurinn - a place we were very excited to try. We tore ourselves away from the beauty of Gulfoss and drove back to our hotel to quickly change clothes before heading into downtown Reykjavik. Having learnt our lesson from the night before, we were not about to just leave the car anywhere - but fuck me, it''s hard to find a parking space around there. We drove around for nearly half an hour before we eventually found a car park with free spaces a fair distance from the restaurant. Late, we were panicking that they would cancel our reservation - but yet again Icelandic hospitality shone through as they were incredibly patient with us. And I tell you now, I''m very glad of that, because that was the best meal of my life, without fail.</p>
<p>I''m serious. There are no words that can describe how perfect this food was. It all started when I was umming and ahhing over whether or not to drink - the beer was rather expensive - but with a little persuasion I was steered towards Snorri No. 10, a pale ale from Borg Brugghús. With hints of arctic thyme and citrus notes, I''m fully aware that it''s not a beer for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. So much so that I had to buy some at the airport to take home, as I could not find any stockists that even export to the UK. This was followed by warm bread with whipped butter and lava salt - lava salt just being black salt, with a slightly less salty taste. The butter was light and delicious.</p>
<p><img src="http://declantyson.net/assets/uploads/2016-11-25/snorri.jpg"><br></p>
<p>To start we shard monkfish skewers, smaller but even tastier than those from the night before. But the real joy of joys was the main course; the fanciest mixed grill I will ever eat - lamb cutlets with what I can only guess was a honey and mustard glaze, pan-fried duck on a bed of duck confit, and thin slices of rib-eye steak. All of this was served on a carrot puree with garlic potatoes and vegetables cooked with a generous helping of butter. I don''t know what they put on this meat, but it was cooked to complete and utter perfection - and the combination of flavours with the potatoes and vegetables was absolutely out of this world. To finish I had a passionfruit caramel chocolate tart - also delicious.</p>
<p>We drove back to the hotel for the last time to await pickup for the Northern Lights tour. Unfortunately they were not visible, but we enjoyed the clearest view of the night sky we''d ever seen, before trying to catch a couple of hours sleep before our flight the next morning.</p>
<p>Our trip in Iceland was something spectacular, a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that has already made us think that maybe we should make it twice-in-a-lifetime. We want to go back in summer to see how different the landscape is not covered in snow, to go snowmobiling on a glacier, to see the Northern Lights and to see more of the city, because three days isn''t close to enough time to see all there is to see. If you''ve ever even considered visiting Iceland, my advice to you is don''t wait. Drop everything else and go. You won''t regret it.</p>

		<div class="content-box resizable movable edit-col col col-100 ui-sortable"><div class="col html-col movable resizable edit-col redactor col-100"><p>In a remarkable twist, I will be writing not one, but two blogs about music before the year is out. This one''s been a while in the making, and it''ll be short, but it''s an album I felt strongly enough about to waffle on about for a bit.</p>
<p>I''ve covered <a href="/siren-charms">In Flames</a> here before, and although I liked their last album I had gripes. It wasn''t particularly memorable - so much so that I don''t actually really remember any of it. It''s definitely the <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> of their discography. It''s good, then, that they''ve followed it up with a <em>Living Daylights</em>, skipping over the oddly-racist and too-old-to-be-doing-this phases.</p>
<p><em>Battles</em> is a welcome return to form from a band that hasn''t hit a proper high in a decade. 2006''s <em>Come Clarity</em> is one of my favourite albums of all time and will likely never be topped, but <em>Battles</em> is certainly their best attempt since that.</p>
<p>Arguably, they''ve been struggling to find their sound since Jesper Strömblad left, which is what has caused the slight dip in quality in the past two albums. It''s been a transitional period to a much lighter, more accessible sound, and to be perfectly honest <em>Battles</em> may well be their lightest album yet. It''s already caused divide amongst the In Flames fans that I know, some of whom prefer the band at their heaviest, yearning for the days gone by of <em>The Jester Race</em> and <em>Whoracle</em>. Others - the camp which includes me - believe that those albums are terribly overrated and the move to melodeath was welcome.</p>
<p>Lead single <em>The End</em>, released back in August, is probably the best song on the album, but it''s one of many. Opening track <em>Drained</em> gives a great introduction into the general feel of the album, whilst the frightfully angsty <em>Like Sand</em> is catchy and enjoyable. Some songs, like <em>Underneath My Skin</em>, fall a little too close to genericide, but for the most part the rest of the album is catchy without being boring.</p>
<p>There is still the trend of their music becoming increasingly lighter and mainstream, which for many will be a barrier that they cannot get past. But for me, <em>Battles</em> is a superb album, and an excellent return to form.</p>
<p>That being said, it is completely and utterly overshadowed by the next album - well, EP - that I am going to write about. Watch this space.</p>

Unlike dear&nbsp;old me, Trent&nbsp;Reznoris a man of his&nbsp;word&nbsp;when&nbsp;it comes to vaguely&nbsp;worded promises, and&nbsp;when he said there&nbsp;would be new&nbsp;NIN&nbsp;in 2016 he meant&nbsp;it - even&nbsp;if&nbsp;it did only&nbsp;arrive&nbsp;in the last 2&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Not The Actual Events</span><span>is a&nbsp;short, angry EP&nbsp;which differs significantly from the later submissions by&nbsp;Reznor, but&nbsp;instead heralds back to the so-called "golden era" of classic NIN&nbsp;where&nbsp;vocals take a back foot to&nbsp;weird noises and static. However,&nbsp;it still manages to take&nbsp;influence from the more electro-sounding efforts of late, and to be honest you could probably say that&nbsp;in 20&nbsp;minutes you can hear&nbsp;pieces of all of their previous albums.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>The album starts off on a heavy note&nbsp;with&nbsp;</span><span>Branches/Bones,&nbsp;</span><span>a&nbsp;short&nbsp;but brutal&nbsp;song, and the one&nbsp;in&nbsp;which Trent''s&nbsp;voiceis most&nbsp;prevelant, akin to the&nbsp;songs that exist on&nbsp;</span><span>Year&nbsp;Zero&nbsp;</span><span>or&nbsp;</span><span>With Teeth</span><span>– from here on out&nbsp;it''s pushed behind the other layers and becomes close to spoken&nbsp;word rather&nbsp;than singing.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>DearWorld</span><span>is the closest you''ll get to&nbsp;</span><span>Hesitation Marks</span><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span>The Slip&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;it''s very different to the other&nbsp;songs on the EP, but still excellent.&nbsp;</span><span>Then you have&nbsp;</span><span>She''s Gone Away&nbsp;</span><span>which could come straight off&nbsp;</span><span>The Downward Spiral</span><span>with&nbsp;it''s heavy use of static, haunting background noise and misery-laden&nbsp;lyrics.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>The standout track&nbsp;is&nbsp;</span><span>The&nbsp;Idea of You.</span><span>It''s sensational.&nbsp;It starts out&nbsp;with a very heavy sounding guitar&nbsp;riff, but then – despite the riff not actually changing –&nbsp;it becomes a fairly slow, chilled out&nbsp;song, simply by overlaying a piano note every few&nbsp;seconds.&nbsp;It''s a sensational mixture of&nbsp;incredibly simple sounds and sums&nbsp;up exactly&nbsp;why&nbsp;Reznoris such a masterful musician. Then, you reach the explosive chorus,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is one of the heaviest sections of music that NIN has ever produced. This&nbsp;is&nbsp;where the&nbsp;influence from&nbsp;</span><span>The Fragile</span><span>&nbsp;comes&nbsp;in.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Burning Bright (Fields on Fire)&nbsp;</span><span>is&nbsp;what&nbsp;Iimagine a&nbsp;song&nbsp;from&nbsp;</span><span>Ghosts&nbsp;I-IV&nbsp;</span><span>would sound like&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were given&nbsp;vocals –&nbsp;in fact&nbsp;it makes me yearn for a&nbsp;</span><span>Ghosts V-VIII</span><span>because that album&nbsp;is one of the best&nbsp;writing&nbsp;inspirations&nbsp;I''ve ever had.</span></p><p></p><p><span>So yes, in five quick songs&nbsp;Reznor&nbsp;and new official band member Atticus Ross have managed to cover around 80% of their sound. However it tells its own story. I need to give it a few more listens – perhaps with the mysterious "physical component" in tow – to discover exactly what that truly is. Ideally, this will pave way for an LP with a similar sound. Even the name implies that the actual events are to come.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

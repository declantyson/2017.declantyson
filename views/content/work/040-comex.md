Comex PPG is Mexico's biggest paint retailer, with over 4,000 stores. When building them an online store, it was required that orders be fulfilled from the closest available store, whether it be pick up or delivery, so this had to be carefully integrated into the user experience, as well as integrating with the existing consumer-facing website.

The store provides a number of ways to browse and purchase products, taking advantage of the 3,500+ colours that the company offers. It was written in English and translated through collabaration with native Spanish speakers in Mexico to ensure that the correct message was delivered.

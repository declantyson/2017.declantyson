Following the takeover of Dairy Crest by MÃ¼ller in 2015, the company was renamed Milk & More, and it remains the UK's premier doorstep delivery service. In 2018 they decided to unshackle themselves from the aging branding they had inherited from Dairy Crest, establishing their own identity in order to revive the great British milkman.

The new Milk & More website is more convenient to use than ever and allows customers to set up both one off and regular deliveries.

Adastral Park is at the heart of BT's Research and Development Unit. They wanted a content-driven site to showcase what they do, their upcoming events and more.

Using React, NodeJS and Umbraco I built them a lightning-fast, beautiful single page application, with the option to output static HTML for rapid deployment across any server anywhere.

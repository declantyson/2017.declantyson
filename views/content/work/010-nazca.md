The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is dedicated to improving the world's attitude to climate change. The NAZCA Climate Portal is one of the tools it uses to convince businesses, cities and investors - both short-term and long-term - to become greener. 

With over eleven thousand commitments and counting, it is a hugely successful project that is continually changing the world, with international recognition from climate change activists including US presidential candidate Al Gore and Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio.

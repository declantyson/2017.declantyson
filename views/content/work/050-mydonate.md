<div class="info">

MyDonate is BT's free fundraising service - unlike JustGiving and VirginMoneyGiving, all monies raised via the service go directly to the charity (paying out an extra 5p in the pound).
				
The iPhone and Android applications allow MyDonate fundraisers to keep up to date with their progress. The app tracks donations and tagets for multiple events and facilitates the promotion of MyDonate fundraising pages using text, email or via Facebook and Twitter. It is easy to use and provides fundraisers more opportunities to raise money for their charities. I recently developed a revamp to the app which is pending release.

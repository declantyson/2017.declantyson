Pictet is a wealth and asset management group based in Geneva, Switzerland that attracts financial institutions and clients with high net worth.
				
I built them  a Retirement Planning sales tool, which runs on both iPads and iPhones. With a sleek and luxurious design and an intuitive user interface, it allows the user to outline their retirement funding by taking in details about their current finances, adjusting their overall spend and investment options, and provide information regarding what Pictet can do for them to secure their financial future.

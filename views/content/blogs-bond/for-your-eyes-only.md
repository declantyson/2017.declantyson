# Blogalongabond: For Your Eyes Only

###### For Your Eyes Only is so forgettable I've already forgotten what I'm talking about

#### 2nd December 2011

### A little bit of background

So it's 1981. Roger Moore is 53, and he looks it. So to say farewell to 007, he's going to do one more film... wait, what? THREE!? Jesus Christ... right, I suppose we'd better get on with this.

Well so far, we've had a good film, then a dumb film, then a good film, then a dumb film with Roger Moore. Any patternologist would be able to tell you what comes next, right? Well, unfortunately, they'd be wrong.

### So, is it any good?

I was looking forward to re-watching For Your Eyes Only, because I simply didn't remember it. It would be like watching a new James Bond film all over again. This isn't because I'd watched it any less than all of the other films, but simply because it's so, so forgettable.

In truth it's not a bad film, it's fairly entertaining, but it's not as good as Live And Let Die or The Spy Who Loved Me, as Roger Moore can't help but put all of his crap one-liners all over it.

### Whatâ€™s the best bit?

Right at the beginning, Roger Moore actually shows a little bit of emotion and his dead wife is actually referred to! I know, shock horror. It's only a brief moment of decent storytelling though before Blofeld - absent for four films prior to this - suddenly comes back with the ability to control a helicopter remotely. Thankfully, Bond drops him down a chimney before they can mess up his character any more - [we'll need to wait until 2015 for that!](/blogalongabond/spectre)

One of the most genuinely funny moments of the series happens in this film, when a group of henchmen attempting to chase Bond try to smash his beautiful Lotus in, taking no notice of the 'Burglary Protected' sign in the window. The car's protection system is in fact an explosion.

I also like Columbo as a sidekick. He's charismatic, funny and has a silly accent.

### And the worst bit?

I'd like to take a minute here to salute the performance of Bernard Lee in all of the Bond films up until this point, for his authoritative and no-nonsense displayal as the head of MI6. His performances, along with Desmond Llewellyn and Lois Maxwell's, painted a brilliant picture of how the British Secret Service worked, and his untimely death was a severe knock to this film as they drafted in James Villiers as the chief of staff to replace him.

With the excuse for M's absence being 'on leave' (I'm thankful they mentioned that he wasn't involved) Bond's briefing scenes are now given by an irritating fool and the Minister for Defence. Whilst Geoffery Keen, as normal, does a good job as the Minister (a similar character to M in many ways), in that he's bossy and mean and yet somehow not dislikable, Villiers is just a twat. His stupid accent, his pathetic attitude - it's all awful. Thank god this is only for one film.

And Margaret Thatcher shouldn't have been anywhere near this film and if I carry on thinking about it I don't know what I'm going to smash so I'll stop there.

### What about the theme tune?

Many people rant and rave about how Blondie should have been given the theme tune, but I actually much prefer Sheena Easton's romantic effort. Although I'm not really a fan of the whole "I'm in the title sequence" thing. I prefer the scantily clad women dancing around on their own without a stereotypical 80's singer in the background.

The rest of the soundtrack is done by Bill Conti, and whilst it's not as good as John Barry's efforts, it's got a pretty good, upbeat, cheesy 80's feel to it. Not bad.

So now we've forgotten the name of that greek man, his friends and uh... someone else that appeared in For Your Eyes Only, let's look forward to a woman with eight vaginas!

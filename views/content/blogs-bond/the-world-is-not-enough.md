# Blogalongabond: The World Is Not Enough

###### An entertaining film but with silly flaws that detriment the experience as a whole

### A little bit of background

There's not a lot of background to talk about except for the fact that Brozzers has well and truly brought Bond back to its dizzying commercial success with his engimatic blend of 90s cheese and nonchalant coldness.

However, I would like to dedicate this Blogalongabond to Desmond Llewellyn, AKA Major Boothroyd AKA Q, whose poignant departure from the series is made all the more emotional by the fact that he sadly passed away in a car crash shortly after filming. The man was a James Bond legend, consistent in every film he appeared in and essentially 007's father figure. He leaves on a brilliant bit of scripting as well - powerful, evocative, showing Bond's dependence and vulnerability. RIP Des.

### So, is it any good?

Like [Tomorrow Never Dies](/blogalongabond/tomorrow-never-dies), TWINE is an entertaining film but with silly flaws that detriment the experience as a whole. However, unlike TND, the ratio of good:bad is weighted towards the positive side. It's a bit darker, the villains are better, and the actors seem much less disinterested and in tune with the script.

It does have some of the same silliness, a questionable script (with some fantastic one-liners but some horrific ones too) and the unnecessary celebrity cameos (Denise Richards should never be ANYWHERE near this series), but it also has some of the series' best moments.

### Whatâ€™s the best bit?

Just like every other single Blogalongabondier, I'm going to rave about the fantastic opening sequence. It's beyond brilliant. Pre-titles go on for nearly quarter of an hour but could pretty much make a film in itself; Bond goes to get some money back that someone's nicked and does it in the way that only Bond can: blowing seven hells out of everyone and then plotting a daring escape by jumping out the window using another human being as an anchor. Then he proceeds to inadvertently cause explosions in the MI6 headquarters (that we're actually allowed to see now!) and nicking Q's boat, causing havoc on the Thames, through the streets of London and by the Millenium Dome. All in all it's a very British opening sequence, down to the (now perfected) Brosnan tie-straighten and what effectively amounts to assault against a traffic warden that the red tops loved to hate.

And the music! Dear god the music! It's just too good. David Arnold excels - not only in the opening sequence but throughout the entire film. He builds and improves on his fantastic work in TND, adding a suitably late-90s-turn-of-the-century-rock-techno vibe.

Sophie Marceau plays Elektra King, a psychopathic bitch whose only goal is chaos. She's a great villain, sadistic, evil, mental, sexy, backstabbing, intelligent... yeah. I think she's great.

Another successful decision was the one to bring back Robbie Coltrane's character Zukovsky. He plays a bigger role than in GoldenEye and brings his usual big-man charisma to it. I'd go as far to say that outside of Q and Judi Dench's M, he's my favourite recurring character in the series (yup, even better than Felix and Moneypenny).

### And the worst bit?

Not all of the guest stars were good.

Unlike the perfectly executed Elektra, Renard 'The Anarchist' is a villain who doesn't meet his considerable potential. Maybe it's because when I look at Rob Carlyle I just see Begby. Maybe it's because he can't avoid his Scottish accent. But I can't believe that he's a Eastern European psychopath who doesn't feel pain due to a bullet in his brain (interesting if strange backstory). He's a Scottish psychopath who kills people for heroin. And he always will be.

Then there's Denise Richards. Frankly, the less said about her the better, but I'm going to rant about her. At length. Her acting is stale, boring and when she's on screen I can't wait for her to leave and Sophie to come back again. She's even worse than Teri Hatcher in TND. At least they attempted to give Paris Carver a little bit of character, but Doctor Christmas Jones (who honestly came up with that name? Was it just to include the closing line 'I thought Christmas only comes once a year'? It's OK, but it's certainly no 'cunning linguist') is literally just a bunny boiler who dresses inexplicably like Lara Croft. She's not a Tomb Raider, she's a nuclear scientist, and we all know Bond's impression of female scientists, so why this glaringly obvious and ultimately pointless popular cultural reference?

And then there's the worst offender. Goldie (character name 'Bullion', trying to emulate his already stupid alias). Even worse than Denise Richards. He's apparently a 'musician' so why he's trying to act in the first place is beyond me. Except it turns out, that in addition to his music and acting being terrible, he became known as a graffiti artist. If Banksy turns up in a Bond film, all hell will break loose.

### What about the theme tune?

Forgettable. In all honesty, it's pretty dire. Garbage may the name of the artist but it's a suitably apt description. Although because I was born on the correct side of the Atlantic, perhaps I should refer to it as 'rubbish'. Although 'shit' would be better still.

Well, that's the peak of Brozzers finished. Are you ready for the pit? [Die Another Day](/blogalongabond/die-another-day) is next.

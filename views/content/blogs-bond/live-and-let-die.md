# Blogalongabond: Live And Let Die

###### A new, silly Bond for a new, silly era  

#### 8th August 2011

### A little bit of background

[Diamonds Are Forever](/blogalongabond/diamonds-are-forever) marked the era of a new direction for the Bond franchise, and with Connery this time departing for good, a replacement needed to be brought in that fit this more light-hearted style more than him. Enter Roger Moore and his juddery eyebrows.

### So, is it any good?

For all his silly jovialism, I will say this for Roger Moore - he fits into the role very well, and isn't too terrible an actor, and unlike On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the film doesn't fall flat because of the lack of Sean Connery.

The film couldn't be more 1970s if it tried. It's the closest Bond gets to blaxpoitation, and xenophobia is, again, one of the primary themes of the film - although this time it's against a generic Carribean nation, who seem united in their aspirations to take down Britain and America. Naturally, they all worship the occult, do tarot readings and dress as if they're in an eternal disco.

Casual racism aside, the film's definitely one of Moore's better entries - it's fun whilst still a little dark, and thoroughly enjoyable throughout.

### What's the best bit?

Jane Seymour's performance as a surpsingly deep, clearly abused girl, is nothing short of brilliant. Similarly, Geoffery Holder, who plays Baron Samedi, does his part perfectly in freaking the audience out. Also, I must say, Bond looks incredibly dapper in Live And Let Die, largely down to his fantastic attire - whoever was in charge of his wardrobe did a spectacular job.

The very best line of the film comes when after Bond gives Rosie Carver a good Rogering and then points a gun at her, demanding information else he kill her. She says 'You wouldn't, not after what we just did,' to which Moore replies, 'Well, I certainly wouldn't have killed you before.' What a lad.

He also stacks a tarot deck full of lover cards and makes Solitaire, who believes blindly in them, to pick one, just to get him to Roger his Moore. What a lad.

### And the worst bit?

I'm not sure if the attempt on Bond's life using the Snake was meant to be a throwback to the Tarantula scene in Dr. No, but it's awful. And the scene that follows with Rosie Carver is absolutely dreadful.

Kananga is also one of the most boring of all the villains in the franchise. His appearances in the picture are breif, unentertaining, and ultimately pointless, and his henchman TeeHee and Baron Samedi are both vastly more interesting characters.

### What about the theme tune?

Bond once said that 'listening to The Beatles without earmuffs' was essentially a criminal offence, so I wonder what he thought of a Beatle doing one of the series' most well known theme tunes. I like it for the most part until it gets to that little reggae bit in the middle, which seemed to be a necessary addition just to fit in with the Carribean theme of the film. John Barry didn't work on this film, but his replacement, George Martain, does the remixes throughout the film and are brilliant as ever.

Roger Moore's reign is off to a pretty good start - but let's wait and see what [The Man With The Golden Gun](/blogalongabond/the-man-with-the-golden-gun) brings before we get too ahead of ourselves...

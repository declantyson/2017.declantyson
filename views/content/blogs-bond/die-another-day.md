# Blogalongabond: Die Another Day

###### The credits end, and it's all downhill from there.

#### 24th August 2012

### A little bit of background

Post 11/9 (read backwards if you’re American) it could have been said that people were beginning to lose faith in the idea of an invincible, infallible hero that defeats evil whilst getting laid and pissed off his nut. However, the producers of Die Another Day didn’t get the memo.

This also marked the 20th Bond film, and the 40th anniversary since [Dr No](/blogalongabond/dr-no). A fact which is celebrated by references to the previous 19 films. I would point them all out, but frankly I can’t be bothered.

Also, cinema was crazy-obsessed with CGI.

### So, is it any good?

It starts off promisingly - Brosnan (beginning to look a little grizzled and old) surfs (for some reason) into North Korea, nicks some diamonds and sets some stuff to blow up. There’s crazy North Korean generals, some east/west cold war hypocrisy references. Bond is discovered, stuff blows up, one of the main villains gets diamonds stuck in his face, they race some hovercraft, and then finally Bond is captured and tortured. It’s an above-average opening sequence - ignoring the horrific line “saved by the bell” it sets the tone for what should have been a highly entertaining film. And then if you mute Madonna, the opening credits are actually fairly haunting and impressive. A little too overdone on the CGI, perhaps, but it advances the plot, which is more than can be said for many other films in the series.

Then the credits end, and it’s all downhill from there.

### What’s the best bit?

The opening sequence is very good, I don’t think anyone can deny that: it’s 15 minutes of genuine entertainment right up until Madonna begins. And aside from that appalling piece of crap, the soundtrack is actually very good throughout.

The tube scene is also good and allows Brosnan to prove that he is actually a relatively good actor, and it’s here that the script actually is pretty good - “an abandoned station, for abandoned agents” - and “while you were away, the world changed” - the only actual reference to 11/9 made in the entire film (and I think that’s probably a sensible decision, to be honest).

And there are some great performances. Judi Dench is a fortress. Her words could cut diamonds; her eyes pierce Brosnan like needles and she shows cold and remorseless a thousand times more than Bernard Lee ever managed. Rosamund Pike is excellent, too.

### And the worst bit?

The amount of CGI in the film is a joke, and it’s a bad joke at that. It all begins with that stupid CGI bullet in the gun barrel sequence - something that was never there before and hopefully will never be again. The kitesurfing sequence harps back to the days when the stuntmen didn’t even look like Roger Moore. It’s so clearly not Brosnan and it doesn’t even vaguely convince you otherwise. And the green screen is done pretty shoddily too. It looks like one of my first ever University projects.

Yet again, there’s too many celebrities with self-indulgent cameos in the film. Halle Berry is just awful and the scene where she’s introduced is so unsubtly a reference to Dr No that it just seems a little pathetic. She tries to do this whole “bad girl” image which is just annoying and she brings many innuendos which bring down the tone of what should be a serious film. Michael Madsen’s role is bordering on irrelevant and he seems to just be there to fill up their famous quota. And whilst I can’t bring myself to insult John Cleese, his Q is poor.

The script is pretty atrocious from beginning to end. There’s a sequence about 86 minutes in that genuinely makes me cringe. Bond to Guy with diamonds in face: _“I’ve missed your sparkling personality”_ Guy with diamonds in face punches Bond: _“How’s that for a punchline?”_ Bond’s fling no. 3749: _“I enjoyed last night, but it really is death for breakfast!”_

But there’s one line that truly stands out for me as an example of the poorest, laziest scriptwriting I’ve seen in any film to date. And it’s not even the “Yo mama” line.

When Jinx and Miranda are fighting at the end, Frost says “I can read your every move!” and Jinx replies by killing her, saying “read THIS, bitch!” It’s not even that I think swearing doesn’t belong in a Bond film. Used right, you could probably drop an f-bomb so long as it’s not made a massive point out of (case in point - see M's perfect delivery of "I've fucked this up" in [Skyfall](/blogalongabond/skyfall)). But this line is so Americanised, so disgustingly crass, and so bloody lazy, that it makes my stomach churn a little.

The film is just so silly. I don’t mind it when Bond films toe the line of making sense but this film picks up the line, shoves it up its arse and squats it out for the next half a mile. Questions include:

- Why can Bond stop his pulse at will?
- Why is the first thing he does after escaping have a shave?
- Why does the Cuban woman in lingerie not give a shit that Bond just KO’d her boyfriend?
- Why would you give someone a makeover but not take out the diamonds stuck in their face before anything else?
- Why would Miranda Frost only stop the swordfight AFTER Bond and Graves have destroyed the entire fencing club?
- Why is there a vanishing car?<
- Why is there a palace made out of ice? I’m not a scientist but I’m not convinced that’s actually possible.
- Whose idea was it to name a character Mr. Kil?
- I know no-one can see the car, but why can nobody hear it or see the tracks it leaves in the snow?
- How is the sun chasing Bond?
- When did he learn to kitesurf?
- How does an ejector seat flip a car the right way up?
- Is it over yet?
- Why doesn’t Jinx cough up loads of water when she recovers from nearly drowning?
- Why is Graves dressed as a robot?
- Why is he so happy he killed his father that he’s trying to impress by taking over the world?
- Why is Miranda Frost wearing basically nothing when she's surrounded by ice? (Although I think I know the answer to this one)
- Why is everything in really stuttery slow-motion?
- Why does Graves have a button on his suit that electrocutes himself?
- Why does the MI6 training simulator double up as a Pierce Brosnan sex doll?
- Why does Jinx like diamonds in her belly button?
- Who signed off on this appalling script?
- WHY IS THERE A FUCKING VANISHING CAR?

Overall it’s a pretty poor way for Brozzers to end his otherwise great time as 007. Before he was Bond, I knew him as the arsehole from Mrs Doubtfire. I wonder which film he regrets more?

And then there’s Madonna. I don’t like Madonna.

### What about the theme tune?

Oh god, it’s just beyond awful. It reeks of an aging shit singer who has no talent desperately trying to make herself relevant in the world once again. Its poorness is almost a metaphor for the Bond series at this point, which desperately needed a kick up the arse after this shitpile.

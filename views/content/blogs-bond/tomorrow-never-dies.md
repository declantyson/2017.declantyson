# Blogalongabond: Tomorrow Never Dies

###### Q: What happens if you make Rupert Murdoch a Bond villain? A: A pretty crap film 

#### 16th June 2012

### A little bit of background

1997: Rupert Murdoch ruled the world and the English had just given control of Hong Kong over to the Chinese. James Bond arrives on the scene to put both China and Murdoch in their place. 

### So, is it any good?

Erm... no. Well, to say it’s bad would be doing it a massive injustice as in parts it’s very entertaining. But it suffers from an incessantly stupid plot, a script that would fit in better to the Bond of the Moore era, and a monotonous cast who - Judi Dench and Jonathan Pryce aside - sound like they’d rather be anywhere else in the world.

Pryce plays the utterly ridiculous character of Eliot Carver fairly well, to his credit. He really gives the impression that he actually enjoys using the catchphrase “delicious”, and that he really would make China and Britain go to war over some newspapers. So he was a good casting decision.

A bad casting decision, however, is Teri Hatcher. Bond girls aren’t supposed to be famous. The producers go on to make the same mistake twice more before realising that it makes the characters unbelievable, irritating and downright dislikable. 

### What’s the best bit?

The opening sequence is again fantastic. It’s a fantastic set piece from start to finish (although when Bond gave up smoking I’m not sure). Judi Dench again kicks ass in putting stuffy old military generals in their place. In fact, she excels throughout the entire film in a much more developed role than in [GoldenEye](/blogalongabond/goldeneye). There are more explosions in this one scene than there are in many of Michael Bay’s most explosive films. It’s just a shame it all gets a little ridiculous when 007 starts flying the plane with his knees. In fact, Brosnan’s first three lines are all Moore-like quips, adequately setting the (low) tone for the rest of the film.

Desmond Llewellyn yet again proves he is the only man on the planet cooler than James Bond. The gadgets are a little over-the-top, but I think it’s one of the redeemable features of this film, as their ridiculousness isn’t quite as bad as other ones, as we will see later in Die Another Day.

Aside from that, the zinger line “cunning linguist” - which totally escaped me at 8 years old - from Moneypenny truly made me laugh. Quite possibly the best one-liner in the entire series.

### And the worst bit?

Teri Hatcher, BMW instead of Aston, the stupid story, the terrible script, the (mostly) atrocious acting. There’s far too many cheesy one-liners. The plot often develops in ways that don’t make a lot of sense, like when Bond willingly goes to what he MUST know to be a beating, just so he can turn off a television broadcast.

All of these, I could forgive, if it wasn’t for one massive plot flaw. When Carver dies - ripped apart by a remote-controlled drill torpedo (yeah, you did read that right) - he has a good 20 seconds where he could have run away from it, instead of watching his impending doom running right towards him and simply letting it happen. So this man - one of the most powerful and intelligent men in the world - is not smart enough to MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OF AN ENORMOUS DRILL.

### What about the theme tune?

It’s a bit warbly, and a sounds a bit like Sheryl Crow was being held at gunpoint whilst she was singing it. It is accompanied by a fantastic, if a little odd, image sequence, which has an X-Ray theme, completely irrelevant to the rest of the film. Oh, and there’s some Diamonds thrown in there for good measure. Because to be honest, this film is on a similar level to [Diamonds Are Forever](/blogalongabond/diamonds-are-forever).

The score as a whole, though, is excellent, and the techno-infused beats are worked better than they were in GoldenEye.

Well, so far in Brosnan’s era we’ve had good-bad. Hint for the next two films: this is a pattern. [The World Is Not Enough](/blogalongabond/the-world-is-not-enough) is up next.

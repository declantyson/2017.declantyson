# Blogalongabond: The Spy Who Loved Me

###### Roger Moore starts getting Bond right.

#### 22nd October 2011

### A little bit of background

After the critical catastrophe that was [The Man With The Golden Gun](/blogalongabond/the-man-with-the-golden-gun), the producers decided to ditch the wackiness a little and ground The Spy Who Loved Me a little more in reality. Back to the cold war we go!

### So, is it any good?

By far the best of Moore's films, it's the one that most feels like a Bond film should. The story is surprisingly deep and considerably darker than all of Rodge's other films (probably put together).

It's definitely Roger Moore's best performance as Bond - it's in this film he successfully found the balance between cheese and subtlety.

### What's the best bit?

Come on, the Union Jack parachute - tacky or not - is pretty awesome.

Moore's darker performance is characterised by the scene where he interrogates a short fat henchman by dangling him over a building with only Bond's tie keeping him alive. After Bond has got the information he wanted, he brushes his tie aside casually, letting him fall to his death. 

Jaws is one of the series' most famous villains and for good reason - standing at over 7 foot Richard Kiel is intimidating, indestructible and downright creepy. Oh, and those steel gnashers don't help, but they do help create one of the film's most genuinely funny moments where Bond smashes his fist round his face only to wince in pain. It's just a shame they went on to completely ruined him in Moonraker...

### And the worst bit?

Barbara Bach's performance is somewhat stale as Anya Amasova AKA Agent XXX (hur hur hur). If she was any good, the scenes where Bond and XXX try to psych eachother out would be much more effective. It irritated me that they had built up a strong, intelligent female character who could have been a brilliant match to Bond's wit when they were working together, but as soon as Bond Rogers her Moore she turns into yet another useless, dim-witted, panicking plank of wood with breasts. There was a missed opportunity here.

### What about the theme tune?

Carly Simon's effort (entitled Nobody Does It Better) isn't too bad but it suffers from a factor beyond its control - Alan Partridge. GLANG, GLANGALANGALANG, ALANGALANGALANG, GLANGALANG...

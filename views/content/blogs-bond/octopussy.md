# Blogalongabond: Octopussy

###### A film of great moments punctuated by stupidity. 

#### 21st January 2012

### A little bit of background

Having already forgotten what [For Your Eyes Only](/blogalongabond/for-your-eyes-only) was about, it's time to move on to \*insert joke about woman with eight vaginas here\*.

In addition to Moore getting pretty old now, his co-star Maud Adams as the titular vagina lady has aged noticably since she was killed in [The Man With The Golden Gun](/blogalongabond/the-man-with-the-golden-gun). Yes, that's right - Adams is (as far as I know) the only actress to play two different Bond girls in the series.

### So, is it any good?

Ignoring this massive continuity error (by this point we've had 3 Bonds and 2 actors to play M, and countless playing Felix Leiter, so I think we can safely say continuity isn't the series' strong point) it's not too bad. I mean, it's nothing spectacular, just a run-of-the-mill Bond film, but since when was that a bad thing?

### Whatâ€™s the best bit?

Steven Berkoff as the psychopathic Russian General Orlov is beyond brilliant. His performance is one of the best in the series and he has a hilarious yet frightening character to back it up.

The scenes in Delhi are very good indeed. I've never been to India, but if I do, I hope it's as crazy as it is in Octopussy. Every part from the motorised rickshaw race to Q's secret base is great fun and massively entertaining - just the way Bond should be.

The jungle chase scene - Tarzan yell aside - is frantic and brilliant as 007 has to escape Kamal Khan's hunting tour in addition to all the majestic dangerous wildlife he encounters.

### And the worst bit?

The 'comic relief' is fuckwittedly dire, and it doesn't fit in to a film that has a somewhat darker tone than most others in the series. But the fact remains that even if the film was as silly as [Moonraker](/blogalongabond/moonraker) or The Man With The Golden Gun, there is no place in James Bond for 007 to be dressing up as a gorilla or a clown. Or do a Tarzan yell.

And where would we be without some unfounded racism - upon handing his Indian sidekick a wad of cash, he says "That should keep you in curries". It's not even very funny.

### What about the theme tune?

Rita Coolidge sings _All Time High_, which isn't really to my taste at all. It's slow and boring. However John Barry returns to the soundtrack and as a whole it's better than For Your Eyes Only.

As Ol' Rodge slows from a canter to a trot, we approach the end of his tenure. Next month, after what seems like a lifetime, is the last time we will see Moore don the tuxedo, in [A View To A Kill](/blogalongabond/a-view-to-a-kill). Thank Christ.

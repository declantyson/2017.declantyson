# Blogalongabond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service

###### Sean Connery goes on holiday and leaves the series in the hands of a less-than-capable babysitter

#### 16th June 2011

### A little bit of background

By now Connery was visibly bored of being 007 and was bashing out unconvincing performances that were detrimental to the film. Whilst he went to work on other projects, Saltzman and Broccoli had to find a replacement to continue the series, and so they went to the land down under - presumably with the mindset that Australians were just exiled Britons still.

They came back with George **fucking** Lazenby, a model with absolutely no acting talent and very little experience.

### So, is it any good?

Storyline-wise, it's probably the best of the series - the screenplay is fantastic and it's thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. The fight scenes are fantastically choreographed and George **fucking** Lazenby.'s physical presence is his key attribute which he uses brilliantly in this scene.

Diana Rigg plays Contessa Teresa di Vincenzo to perfection as the complicated character with an obvious affection for Bond, although she hates to admit it at first, and her death shortly after their wedding is extremely touching and by far the most emotional scene of the entire franchise.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service SHOULD be the best film in the series, but it's not, due to one, massive, glaring flaw.

George **fucking** Lazenby.

### What's the best bit?

Although sad, the final 10 minutes of the film, are absolutely superb, as the scenes of complete joy from the entire cast - including Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and a touchingly tearful performance from Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny - are shattered like the glass on the windscreen of Mr and Mrs James Bond's honeymoon car. Perhaps even more heart-wrenching is the few seconds Bond takes to realise what's happened, before the camera reveals the bullet in Tracy's head.

As the police bike pulls up and the instrumental version of We Have All The Time In The World plays, it takes a heart of stone not to feel anything; it's an unparalleled level emotion that will never be seen in the series again.

### And the worst bit?

You'd get better acting from a duck and it would suit the role better - George **fucking** Lazenby seems to spend the entire film trying to remember to keep up his overly stereotyped Queen's English accent and completely forgetting to show any emotions, even when the love of his life is murdered in front of him.

The utmost worst part, though, is when he breaks the fourth wall to remind us that there was a far superior actor that we're missing out on - "This never happened to the other fella".

### What about the theme tune?

John Barry's work on OHMSS is probably his best. It has two 'theme tunes' - the one that plays on the title sequence and at various points throughout the film, an epic instrumental track that is classic Bond - and We Have All The Time In The World, sung by Louis Armstrong. Both are perfectly to the film and Louis Armstrong's track is beautiful and haunting at the same time.

---

OK, that's quite enough of George **fucking** Lazenby. Let's get Sean Connery back so that we can have a proper revenge thriller next time in [Diamonds Are Forever](/blogalongabond/diamonds-are-forever), which will definitely be a serious and gritty film.

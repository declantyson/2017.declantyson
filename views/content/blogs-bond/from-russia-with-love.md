# Blogalongabond: From Russia With Love

###### Surprisingly, one of the few Bond films that's actually about spies

#### 9th February 2011

### A little bit of background

Having recovered sixty times its budget at the box office, [Dr. No](/blogalongabond/dr-no) demanded a sequel. With the cold war in full flow and (largely thanks to the previous film) spies and secrets all the rage, Saltzman and Broccoli decided that From Russia With Love should be the next adaptation. With a doubled budget - and a double paycheck for returning star Sean Connery - we are taken on a journey of SMERSH, SPECTRE and other confusingly similar acronyms.

### So, is it any good?

From Russia With Love took the formula that had worked so well from Dr. No and built upon it with astounding efficiency. New Bond archetypes were introduced - the villainous girl whom turns to the side of England because of Bond's magnificent British penis, and the ridiculously buff henchman that you couldn't dent with a sledgehammer.

It not only betters its predecessor, but it blows it clean out of the Soviet submarine-infested water - the magnificent sidekick Kerim Bey is a hundred times better than Quarrel (although Connery still has issues pronouncing his name correctly) and the storyline as a whole is considerably deeper than Dr. No's, and a hundred times more entertaining.

Plus we have my favourite double entendre of the entire series - "I think my mouth is too big." "It's the right size... for ~~my cock~~ me that is!"

### What's the best bit?

In a film with so many standouts, it's difficult to pick a favourite aspect: but I personally am a massive fan of Red Grant and every scene he appears in. Built like a skyscraper, well-spoken, cold, intelligent and just an ever-so-slight hint of psychosis, he's everything a good villain should be, and Robert Shaw portrays him brilliantly.

Grant and Bond's fight on the Trans-Siberian Express is a classic action scene, typifying the English people's opinion of Russia in a few minutes: trains and communists. I also think that 007's do-everything suitcase is one of the best gadgets he's ever had - hell, I want a suitcase that's got 100 quid hidden in it and disperses gas at anyone who opens it!

And let's not forget Tatiana Romanava, one of my favourite Bond girls for her story more than anything - and the first of many to betray mother Russia for thirty seconds of Connery inside her. Daniela Bianchi displays her difficulties of choosing between cock and country very well indeed.

### And the worst bit?

There's no part of From Russia With Love that I'd consider to be bad, but seeing as I have to choose a worst bit, it would have to be the ending - as James and Tatiana sit in front of a green screen at Pinewood Studios sail down the Venitian Rivieira, Bond looks at stills of a sex tape he inexplicably obtained of the pair of them, and then throws it into the river. It's just very dated and feels rushed compared to the rest of the film.

### What about the theme tune?

Matt Munro's crooning vocals are fantastic, and the first 'proper' Bond theme is one of the best. Composed by Lionel Bart, it's sombre without being depressing, and has that 'Fallout' vibe about it. It's also the first film legendary composer John Barry worked on, and he began his tradition of implementing the theme song into the instrumental music of the film, pulling it off superbly.

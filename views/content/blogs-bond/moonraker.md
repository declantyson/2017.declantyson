# Blogalongabond: Moonraker

###### Roger Moore reaches peak Roger Moore.

#### 12th November 2011

### A little bit of background

The next Bond film after [The Spy Who Loved Me](/blogalongabond/the-spy-who-loved-me) was _supposed_ to be [For Your Eyes Only](/blogalongabond/for-youre-eyes-only), but then, uh, Star Wars happened and made a stupid amount of money. People say that this was before George Lucas started ruining everything he touched, but he inadvertently messed up James Bond by convincing Cubby Broccoli that everyone liked space. And thus, Moonraker was filmed.

### So, is it any good?

Moonraker is just silly. From start to finish, it is silly. Actually, scratch that. It's downright fucking stupid. Right from the very beginning where Jaws - who in The Spy Who Loved Me was an intimidating, frightening assassin - is seen to be flapping like a bird when his parachute inexplicably fails to open sets the tone for the absolute idiocy that will follow for the next 120 minutes.

And then there's the whole space station bollocks. I understand that all of the James Bond films are a little fantastical but people flying around in space firing lasers at eachother takes the piss, just a little bit.

### What's the best bit?

Hugo Drax, the film's antagonist is a lot more convincing than Karl Stromberg was in The Spy Who Loved Me - a villain with essentially the same idea, just in space aside from underwater. The pressure simulator scene is very tense and Moore's performance in this scene is actually quite good - unlike the rest of his acting in Moonraker.

Other than that, er... I guess it's not as boring as [Thunderball](/blogalongabond/thunderball)?

### And the worst bit?

Fuck me, where to start?

Well the fact that his camera has 007 on it is the pinnacle of stupidity. As a **secret agent** working in **espionage**, why the fucking dicks would you have your codename written on something that you hold up to your face?

The Gondola scene is idiotic. There is no explanation as to why this Gondola has all these gadgets in it, and there's a double taking pigeon. I'll repeat that, because I can't emphasise quite how crap it is: A DOUBLE TAKING PIGEON.

But the lowest point, the lowest of the low, is when Jaws falls in love and turns over a new leaf. The once heart-stopping villain reduced to comic relief and someone not frightening at all - it's laughable, but not because it's humorous. Pathetic. Also incidentally, [Dolly never wore braces](https://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/moonraker-dolly-did-not-wear-braces). I still can't quite believe that.

### What about the theme tune?

Shirley Bassey returns for her final - and by her own admission, worst - theme tune. It's slow, dull and supposed to be sci-fi, but it's not. Poor effort.

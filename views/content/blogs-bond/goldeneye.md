# Blogalongabond: GoldenEye

###### GoldenEye is not only the very best Bond film, it's the best god damn film of all time. And you can quote me on that.

### A little bit of background

Possibly because of the higher certificate, [Licence to Kill](/blogalongabond/licence-to-kill) seriously underperformed at the box office. Which is ridiculous. This, coupled with various legal disputes, meant that it was 6 years before the next James Bond film, and Timothy Dalton grew a bit bored, buggering off to do some Shakespeare or whatever.

He was replaced by someone previously shortlisted for the role, some Irish guy who played a detective or something in some kind of TV series, a one Mr. Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan is very much a middle-of-the-road Bond in my views. Whilst all of the other Bonds excel in one particular area, but perhaps lack in others (Connery: Suave, Lazenby: Physicality, Moore: Wit (this one's debatable), and Dalton: Seriousness) Brosnan displays all of these attributes, if not to the same level of expertise. This is definitely a good thing though, as we can sit back and watch the film without worrying that when there's an opportunity for a one-liner, it won't be missed, but at the same time, when Bond needs to be pissed off, he can be pissed off. He can believably hold his own in a fight, but unlike Lazenby, his acting talent isn't worse than a dead pheasant.

### So, is it any good?

Maybe it's the nostalgia. It was the first Bond I ever watched, and I was instantly hooked. Having read some of the other reviews so far, it seems to be the general consensus that it wasn't as good as they remembered it to be. However, watching it back today, I have to disagree.

GoldenEye is not only the very best Bond film, it's the best god damn film of all time. And you can quote me on that.

### Whatâ€™s the best bit?

So a good Bond film has to start with a good villain. And for this we have three of the best in the whole series. Xenia Onatopp, who literally gets off from homicide, releasing orgasmic groans every time she fires her weapon or crushing someone between her thighs during sex. General Arkady Gregorovic Ouromov, Head of Space Division. A man who as a child taught me that most Russians were insane psychopath miltants. And last but definitely not least, the inimitable Sean Bean, who as always delivers the manliest performance ever. His back and forth with 007 in the opening sequence is brilliant (_'Closing time James, last call!' 'Buy me a pint!'_). In fact, the entire opening sequence is pure brilliance. Bean he also has the honour of delivering the fantastic line _'What is true is that in 48 hours you and I will have more money than God'_, just one of thousands of quotable lines in this gem-laden script.

The supporting characters are also fantastic. Judi Dench comes in as M and gives the character a damn good kick up the arse. She immediately puts Bond in his place and brings more depth to the role than any of her male predecessors, commanding more respect and showing more humanity. There's a good reason this lady is a Dame. Desmond Llewellyn (Q) also gets a considerable amount of screentime (although not as much as in Licence To Kill) as his character begins to be more prevalant in the Brosnan era. He seems to get on better with Bond than he used to, and the whole scene is thoroughly entertaining. Boris Grischenko is another insane Russian (no shortage of them in this series, is there?) whose catchphrase _'I AM INVEENCIBULL'_ is a brilliant one. We have Robbie Coltrane in his pre-Hagrid days portraying another... insane Russian. And Natalya is a pretty standard Bond girl.

And let's not forget about the __tank__. Bond drives a fucking tank through St. Petersburg, tearing up the whole place. Possibly the best part about it is the fact that there's very little hint to it happening. It's literally only 10 seconds before the chase takes place we have any indication, as Bond tries in vain to chase Ouromov on foot, we swing the camera round to see the behemoth of a vehicle, and we have just enough time to think 'No... surely not' before it smashes through a wall to the Bond theme blasting out at its apex.

But there's one thing, one incredible thing that came from this film, that changed the face of another industry forever - Rare's Nintendo 64 videogame adaptation. Now's not the time or place to discuss how influential or good the game was, but there's no denying its influence on the industry. And the film might not have been as influential, but it was just as bloody good.

### And the worst bit?

There's only one flaw with this film. What if Timothy Dalton had stuck it out and decided to play Bond in this movie? I only think he didn't because he knew it would be too much awesome for our simple little minds to take and might cause the whole universe to collapse under the weight of how indescribably incredible it could have been.

### What about the theme tune?

Tina Turner bashes out another Bond classic, up there with my favourites - it's not quite as much to my tastes as some of the other recent entries, but there's a catchiness about it that just keeps it in your head, and coming out of your mouth after drinking a little too much Vodka from Ouromov's hip flask (hey, when in Russia, do as the Soviets do!).

So that's the best film ever. Everything else in your life that follows will be a disappointment, starting with [Tomorrow Never Dies](/blogalongabond/tomorrow-never-dies).

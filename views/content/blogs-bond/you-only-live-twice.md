# Blogalongabond: You Only Live Twice

###### A little bit racist but a lot of fun

#### 15th May 2011

### A little bit of background

With the Space Race well and truly underway, the Cold War was now about getting further into space than the other side. It's a couple of years to go before the moon landing, so it was the perfect time for James Bond to play his new role as peacemaker between the Yanks and the Ruskies - by... faking his own death and moving to Japan?

### So, is it any good?

Whilst not orbiting at the dizzying heights of the first three films, You Only Live Twice improves massively on the awful [Thunderball](/blogalongabond/thunderball). Whilst the story is completely ludicrous and Connery's performance is his most disinterested yet, it's thoroughly entertaining and the action sequences from Bond running across a rooftop in Japan to several hundred Ninjas charging a volcano are very well done. The locations and sets are stunning, and, unlike other entries to the series, the silliness doesn't detract too much from the overall tone of the film.

### What's the best bit?

The climax of the film in the volcano is one of the most thrilling sequences in the series. The reveal of Blofeld, which has been built up to in three films now - is brilliantly played by Donald Pleasance, the best actor to portray him. His disfigured face and strange accent suit the character perfectly and I only wish that Pleasance had taken the role a few more times - it would make the series' most famous villain a much better character.

And then the ninjas arrive in their droves, and the action is frantic, non-stop and absolutely brilliant.

### And the worst bit?

Like Goldfinger, discrimination is rife in You Only Live Twice - but in addition to belittling the fairer sex, this time it paints the most stereotypical portrait of the Japanese I've ever seen. Here's a quick run down of the cultural aspects they show of the land of the rising sun:

- Paper houses
- Sumo wrestlers
- Ninjas
- Magical resolution-increasing cameras
- Chopsticks

Oh, and Little Nelly is utterly ridiculous.

### What about the theme tune?

A much better entry than Thunderball, Nancy Sinatra and John Barry manage to nail the Asian theme perfectly without being overtly racist or xenophobic. Whilst not the best song that Bond will ever produce it's a servicable addition.

Seeing as Connery doesn't give a shit anymore, next time the powers that be decided to give [On Her Majesty's Secret Service](/blogalongabond/on-her-majestys-secret-service), the most character-forming film of the entire series, to an unknown model from Australia. I wonder how that will work out?

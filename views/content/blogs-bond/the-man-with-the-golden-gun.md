# Blogalongabond: The Man With The Golden Gun

###### Kung Fu, nipples, car flips, and a distinct lack of self-awareness

#### 15th September 2011

### A little bit of background

Ol' Rodge's second film arrived in the mid-seventies, and Britain had just seen the end of an energy crisis. Typical of Bond, this massive political event is reflected in the film, and it provides 007's main objective.

It was also released at the height of the craze Britain had for kung fu movies, and so, naturally, Bond must become a martial arts expert to rival Bruce Lee himself to get through the film unharmed.

### So, is it any good?

I remember when I was a kid, The Man With The Golden Gun was one of my favourite Bond films, but watching it back now, it's a bit shit. The script is limp, characterization is poor and aside from Christopher Lee all of the performances are shocking.

I think that the reason I enjoyed it so much at 8 years old is because it's so light-hearted and comedic. Every aspect of it is made light of, from the kung fu to the midget to Britt Ekland's portrayal of Bond's idiotic sidekick to the to the flying car to the antagonist's third nipple. It's exactly the sort of crap that kids lap up, but it's a little too fantastic and silly to watch once you're past the age of 11.

### What's the best bit?

Scaramanga's Golden Gun is actually one of my favourite gadgets in the series (and not just because it's awesome in Goldeneye 64). I love the scene where he kills Hai Fat, and puts the weapon together right in front of him without him noticing. It's a brilliant concept for a gun.

The stunt where Bond flips the car is simply fantastic. It was done in one take and luckily done first time or else it would have taken a consdierably larger chunk out of the budget. Sadly, it's ruined by the stupid whistle sound effect that is played over the top.

Also, despite all their tackiness, the kung fu sections are pretty genuinely entertaining, and the slutty naked Chinese girl in the swimming pool also provides Moore's best eyebrow raise when she tells him to 'Chu Mi'.

However the best part of The Man With The Golden Gun is that we never see Sheriff J.W Pepper ever again.

### And the worst bit?

There are several low points in The Man With The Golden Gun, but the worst has to be when Bond discovers ~~Octopussy~~ Andrea Anders murdered, and the plastic/wax/whatever model is horrifically unrealistic, and Guy Hamilton (director) seems to want to make it really obvious how bad it is by showing it close up from every angle. Terrible.

### What about the theme tune?

Dreadful doesn't even begin to describe this atrocity. I don't know who Lulu is and I don't care. What's most annoying is that a [perfectly acceptable version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tV8v697SBY) by Alice Cooper was completely shunned. Sigh.

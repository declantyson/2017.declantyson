# Blogalongabond: Licence to Kill

###### Timmy Dalton returns in a blaze of awesomeness, explosions, and a mythical Latin American country drowning under a wave of stereotype.

### A little bit of background

When you hear the word “bastard” in the first 5 seconds of a Bond film, you know you're in for something different.

In The Living Daylights, Timothy “God” Dalton proved that he had what it takes to take Bond to the level that it needed to. It was just the right side of sinister whilst retaining all of the right elements that made it not just a film, but a Bond film. Combine this with certain key factors: the Cold War was officially over by the time of its release, and American big-budget action thrillers (notably Die Hard and Lethal Weapon) were doing the rounds at the box office, and you have the most hardcore 007 outing to date.

### So, is it any good?

Absolutely fantastic. This is the film Diamonds Are Forever could have, should have been: an angry, disillusioned Bond runs riot in cold-blooded revenge with no motivation except to avenge his friend. Taking down a mass-murdering drug dealer in the process is just a convenient and fortunate side-effect.

There's a bit of swearing, the fake blood budget is marked up generously, and the darker themes give it something no Bond film has been given before or since, a 15 certificate. (This will probably be rescinded to a 12 upon the Blu-ray release, it's not actually that bad by modern day standards).

### What's the best bit?

Timothy Dalton. There is no better actor to play Bond; and arguably no better actor in the world. When he discovers Della and Felix's bodies, his reaction is incredibly believable: his cry of “Della!” followed by a face of grief, followed by the jittering rage that pulses through his body when he reads that amazing note: “He disagreed with something that ate him”. But there's so much more:

- THAT stunt with the truck
- "He was married once, but it was a long time ago".
- Felix being fed to the shark. It's SUCH a drastic change of tone to the series, and an indication of the film - and Dalton's role - being closer to Fleming's idea than the flimsy cheese that Moore output. Incidentally, though, in the novels it actually happened in Live and Let Die, which was the second book in the series. Up to this point Felix had appeared in seven films, so he's actually done comparatively well for himself.
- Bond finally stands up for himself against M, and unlike On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moneypenny isn't there to sort it out. So instead of a boring half hour on top of a ski slope, we spend an exciting hour and a half blowing up half of a stereotyped Latin America.
- "Compliments of Sharky!" It's not the line that makes this brilliant, just the fact that Bond - surrounded by armed guards - has the balls and the anger to get revenge there and then, with no thought to anything else. And of course, Dalton's delivery is perfect.
- Q's role in the film reminds you it's still 007, and Desmond Llewellyn provides us with a little comic relief as the grandfather-like figure who deeply cares about Bond.
- Bond's double take at Pam Bouvier when she walks in all scrubbed up. The latin guitar sting just adds to it.
- The iguana.
- Sanchez is an interesting villain - apart from conforming to certain Latin stereotypes (“you got big cojones”, is a cocaine dealer) - and just an all round bastard.
- "Watch the birdie, you bastard."
- Head explosion. ‘nuff said.

I could go on all night, because pretty much every part of this film is amazing.

### And the worst bit?

It's Timothy Dalton's last film! :(

Being serious about critiquing the film itself, though, it did lack the scope and grandeur of other entries to the series, but that's because it's so much more based in reality, so in a way it's not necessarily a bad thing. Neither of the girls really impressed me that much, Lupe Lamora - a character with great potential and depth - is poorly acted by Talisa Soto, and Pam Bouvier - though well portrayed by Carey Lowell - is pretty irritating.

###  What about the theme tune?

Although it doesn't stand up as well on its own as A View To A Kill, Gladys Knight's thumping 80s power ballad is a brilliant song and fits in perfectly to the more Americanised, Die-Hard film that Licence to Kill is, and when Bond and Felix return to the wedding on parachutes (like a boss), the first few triumphant bars give a sense of awesome victory. It's still a damn fine 80s tune, and has rarely been bettered since.

Next month it's Goldeneye. Prepare yourselves.

# Blogalongabond: Thunderball

###### Thunderball is the first film in the series that is a little bit shit. 

#### 15th April 2011

### A little bit of background

After yet another rousing box office success, Thunderball commanded three times the budget on [Goldfinger](/blogalongabond/goldfinger). Connery returned to the fray, but by this point he was showing signs of being slightly bored of the role. 

### So, is it any good?

Thunderball is the first film in the series that is a little bit shit. In fact, I'd say it held the rather undistinguished position of worst Bond flick for 43 years. Every single actor to play James Bond who has reached the four-film mark seems to suffer from this same problem - we will see it again later in both [Moonraker](/blogalongabond/moonraker) and [Die Another Day](/blogalongabond/die-another-day). 

It's easy to see where the budget was blown: around half an hour of the film is underwater, which must have commanded a fair amount of the $9 million (around Â£90 million in today's money and in the right country), as I expect most of the actors would have needed extensive diving lessons, expensive scuba equipment and of course decent cameras that could capture underwater perfectly.

But the underwater segments are boring, slow, and confusing. In videogames, even the best ones, underwater levels are consistently the worst - a prime example being the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time - and if Thunderball is anything to go by, underwater and film don't go together either.

Connery seems a little more arrogant and disinterested in the role this time around, and although Bond needs to have a certain swagger about him, there's a point at which it stops being suave and appealing, instead making him seem like a complete dick.

### What's the best bit?

Despite my little rant there, Thunderball isn't all bad - it's got some fantastic bits. The pre-title sequence with the jetpack is one of the series' best, if a little disconnected from the story - the jetpack one of Bond's best gadgets, albeit somewhat fantastical (where was he hiding that thing anyway?).

Luciana Paluzzi also excels as sultry, big-boobed assassin Fiona Volpe, and the scene in which she shoots down 007's sexual prowess is nothing short of a stroke of genius. A perfect femme fatale, she makes for one of the more interesting Bond girls.

### And the worst bit?

The thirty or so minutes spent underwater is simply terrible. I completely lose concentration, because you can't figure out who's on what side, and all of these people are being killed by harpoon but as far as the audience knows, it could have just been some traveller lazily swimming through as he experiences the coral reef of the Carribean for the first time. There's no character empathy as I had no idea who the hell they were. It goes on for too long and it feels like a chore to watch - there's no entertainment to be found in what must have been a budget-busting sequence. Wasted.

### What about the theme tune?

The worst (almost) Bond film also commands the worst (almost) theme tune (both being surpassed in 2002). Tom Jones sings nonsensical lyrics over a melody that sounds more like a parody of the series rather than what it's supposed to (although this might not be John Barry's fault, rather Mike Myers). The less said about Thunderball, both the music and the film, the better. Avoid.

A temporary dip in form for Connery, but it is indeed only temporary. [You Only Live Twice](/blogalongabond/you-only-live-twice) follows.

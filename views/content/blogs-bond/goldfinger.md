# Blogalongabond: Goldfinger

###### If you've never seen a James Bond film, this is the one to start with. 

#### 9th March 2011

### A little bit of background

Another rousing success at the box office saw [From Russia With Love](/blogalongabond/from-russia-with-love) take nearly forty times its budget and $20 million more than [Dr. No](/blogalongabond/dr-no). James Bond had arrived on the global scale and Sean Connery was an international icon.

 Demand for the world's best secret agent was at an all-time high, but with the dreaded third film upon them, Saltzman and Broccoli needed to tread carefully - the series would either flop at this point or go on to be bigger than any franchise the world had seen before.
 
### So, is it any good?

If you've never seen a James Bond film, this is the one to start with. It's got everything the series is well known for in abundance - out-of-this-world and yet still realistic gadgets, several women that Bond lies with who, alas, meet their doom shortly thereafter, an unbeatably tough henchman (this time he's Korean and has a nifty hat), an evil and ruthless yet somewhat likeable villain, and tension, action and double entendres (Pussy) galore.

One decision that was made that I feel was very good was the removal of SPECTRE - Saltzman and Broccoli quickly realised that not all of Bond's assignments should be masterminded by Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and that some diversity would be good for the series.

### What's the best bit?

The scene where 007 is tied to a solid gold table whilst a laser threatens to tear his body entwain, cock first, is possibly the most tension-inducing scene in the history of cinema. For the first time ever, we see Bond lose his cool and nonchalant attitude to death, and it is in this scene that Connery displays his finest acting in the role: the subtle panicking as he throws out random phrases he has heard in conversation, and the sheer relief as Goldfinger eventually, and foolishly, listens to him and turns the laser off. This scene will prove to be the inspiration for thousands of parodies.

And let's not forget the ejector seat - although the special effects are dated the hilarity remains, (if only caused by the unnamed henchman's comedy scream) one of the franchise's most genuinely funny moments.

### And the worst bit?

Now I'm not adverse to the odd bit of light-hearted humour about gender - but the sexism on display here is way past the borderline. The whole film toes the line very carefully, but when Connery slaps Dink's arse and says "Man talk" to get her to leave, it shows just how large the power gap between genders was in the sixties. It's very dated and, fucking hell, there is no chance that scene gets into cinema today.

There's also the almost-rape of Pussy Galore. Yeah, bit awkward that.

### What about the theme tune?

Shirley Bassey's first of three Bond themes is undoubtedly her best, and the music and lyrics both fit the picture's antagonist superbly - it definitely feels like Auric Goldfinger's theme tune, helped in no small measure by another superb arrangement by John Barry.

Goldfinger is the "classic" Bond film. It sets up all of the tropes for the years to come. How will [Thunderball](/blogalongabond/thunderball) compare?

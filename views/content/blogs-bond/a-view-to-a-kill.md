# Blogalongabond: A View To A Kill

###### Another eyebrow-waggling averageathon

#### 22nd February 2012

### A little bit of background

To be honest, I'd say at this point the series that I love so much has - despite what Rita Coolidge might have you believe - hit an all-time low. Roger Moore should have stopped three films ago, and yet Broccoli keeps on bashing out film after average film with ol' Rodge in the vain hope that he becomes a suitable 007. Thankfully though, this is the last time we see him (and, as it turns out, we don't even see him that much).

The 1980s is now well and truly underway in all its tacky glory and the world is obsessed with computers and microchips. As usual, Bond is up to date on all of the latest trends and is even credited with inventing one - snowboarding took off in a big, big way after Moore<sup>('s stunt double)</sup> took to the slopes in A View To A Kill.

### So, is it any good?

Duran Duran! Christopher Walken! Grace Jones! Computers! 1980s culture! This should be the best Bond yet! Of course, though, it isn't, because Roger Moore's in it. A View To A Kill is mostly another eyebrow-waggling averageathon, but it doesn't matter, because next time we have Timothy Dalton.

### Whatâ€™s the best bit?

Both May Day and Zorin are fantastic villains, and although many critics deemed Walken's assassination of his minions with a machine gun unnecessary as the film was already dark enough, I think it showed just how batshit insane he is. Moore said "It wasn't what Bond is all about" but he just thinks Bond is about shagging women 35 years too young for him so let's ignore his opinion in this case.

In fact, the only person in the film more dangerously insane than Zorin is Grace Jones, who is absolutely terrifying at the best of times but even more so when you give her a mental character to play. Even her final moments as she turns heroic are laced with psychosis.

The only slight flaw with Zorin's character is that apparently he can speak 6 languages without an accent when Walken can't speak fucking English without an accent.

### And the worst bit?

The stunts are amazing, and some of the best seen in the series, but they'd be a hell of a lot better if you could actually believe it was 007 doing them. There's not even an attempt to hide the fact that Moore is far too old to perform anything so physically taxing, and it almost seems that they are deliberately pointing out that he's not in the film that much.

Additionally, the scene in which they say the film's title - nonsensical enough as it is - well, makes no sense.

_May Day: "What a view." Zorin: "To a Kill..."_

....what?

One final point to bemoan, Tanya Roberts' performance as Stacey Sutton only detriments the film further, as her character cannot decide if she's a brilliantly intelligent heiress to a ridiculously profitable company or a complete moron who simply screams the whole time without any redeeming features to motivate the struggle of watching her performance. Although for 120 minutes of the film, Roger Moore FINALLY realised that these girls are too young for him. WELL DONE YOU, RODGE. (Of course he's in the shower necking with her in the closing sequence).

### What about the theme tune?

Duran Duran are just undeniably awesome. God knows what the lyrics mean but the song is awesome and that tacky neon title sequence that backs it is beyond cool. The 80s really were an epic decade. John Barry, as per usual, does excellently adapting this into a proper soundtrack and not a disco.

So we're finally rid of Roger Moore. Hooray! Now we get Timothy Dalton! HOORAY!

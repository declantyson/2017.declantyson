# Blogalongabond: Dr. No

###### A legend is born.

#### 2nd January 2011

### A little bit of background

The swinging 60's, and the revolution has begun. No longer was it taboo for people to have sex with whomever they pleased, nor for films to show that, and heaps of gratuitous violence, on the big screen. It was the perfect time for Fleming's creation to be born, and born he was, bursting from the of the pages of a book and into the shining bright lights of cinema.

To play the character, the manliest of men, you needed someone with sex appeal, machismo, and a strong physical presence. Sean Connery and his strangest of accents fit the bill perfectly - he had a presence that men and women alike found irresistable.

### So, is it any good?

A stunning first entry into what was to become a stunning series, Dr. No would establish many (although not all) of 007's key themes and ideals. From start to finish, it's tense, action-packed, sexy and funny. In Connery's first outing as Bond he fits the role effortlessly, and the film's locations across the Carribean are beautiful and fantastic - every aspect of it makes you envious of Bond's life.

It's by no means perfect - the script is a little bit weaker than some other entries in the series but it's still a fantastic place to start from, and for a few films the series would go from strength to strength.

### What's the best bit?

Without trying to sound clich√©, it has to be the classic scene of Honey Ryder emerging from the sea in that classic bikini. At the time it was unseen to have that much flesh on show, and Ursula Andress became an instant sex symbol. Despite the fact that now her attire may be slightly dated, she's become iconic, and the archetypal Bond girl.

But that's far from the only good scene - when Bond introduces himself to Sylvia Trench is a masterclass in character introduction. Remaining unseen while he kicks the shit out of her at cards, he simultaneously condescends and compliments her, before returning her own introduction back at her while the James Bond theme tune (you've got to remember the guy has a fucking theme tune) plays over Connery's cool, suave and seductive delivery of 'Bond... Jamesh Bond.'

And the tarantula scene is a superb demonstration of how tension can be built by music and a massive hairy spider crawling over you.

### And the worst bit?

While not poor as such, I'm not a huge fan of Dr. No himself as a villian - he's not in it for long enough to make an impact and his death is a little anti-climactic. Although to be honest, anyone with robot hands that crush everything is definitely intimidating. 

### What about the theme tune?

Unless you count The James Bond Theme itself, Dr. No doesn't have a theme tune. But let's focus on that most well-known of all 007's music - it has the grand vibe of orchestral cinema whilst having the sting of the 60's in it. It's a little bit cheesy, it's a little bit sneaky, it's a little bit epic, it's perfect in every single way.

Dr. No is a great place to start. But as we'll see next time, in [From Russia With Love](/blogalongabond/from-russia-with-love), we can go even further still.

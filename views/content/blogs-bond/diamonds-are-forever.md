# Blogalongabond: Diamonds Are Forever

###### Bond mourns the death of his wife by prancing around in Las Vegas

#### 15th July 2011

### A little bit of background

[On Her Majesty's Secret Service](/blogalongabond/on-her-majestys-secret-service) - although still a relative commercial success - was widely panned, and even more so was the actor to portray Bond, George Lazenby. Producers Saltzman and Broccoli too had a difficult relationship with the actor - at the premiere of OHMSS, they wanted Lazenby to turn up looking like 007, and so naturally the dickhead turned up with long hair and a beard.

A combination of this rocky relationship and the critical dumping of the actor as a whole, they turned to one man that they were certain wouldn't disappoint them: Sean Connery returns as James Bond.

By this time the 70s had ejaculated its shiny disco fluids all over the franchise and Diamonds Are Forever was the first film to adopt the series' new direction of being more light-hearted and comedic.

### So, is it any good?

Possibly the most sleazy of all of the James Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever has a few high points and several low points. Set half in Amsterdam and half in Las Vegas, the sleaziest locations in the whole world, 007 sleazes his way into the bed of a diamond smuggler while a sleazier, camper Blofeld and his two sleazy, gay, creepy henchmen sleaze after him.

I hope I've painted a sleazy enough picture there.

However, it's still somewhat entertaining, and the film benefits from having an actor that can actually act once again, although it's pretty clear that he's starting to give up.

### What's the best bit?

I do actually quite like Charles Gray's depiction of Blofeld - it's a little bit camp and totally different to the previous representations, but he pulls it off quite well as a charismatic, arrogant villain with an unnecessarily convoluted plan.

The scene when Bond brings back one of his slags to nob in his hotel room is pretty good, where the gangsters throw her into the pool, and Connery utters another brilliant double entendre "I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up!".

### And the worst bit?

Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are downright creepy, but that's far from the worst part about this film. The worst part of Diamonds are Forever is the absolutely embarrassing pre-title sequence in which Bond hunts down Blofeld in revenge for killing his wife. Should be an awesome scene, but it's just a sequence of poorly-strung together events where Bond emotionlessly traipses across the globe until he eventually finds who he believes to be Blofeld and kills him. There's no emotion, it's incredibly poorly edited and there's no feeling of success or victory (possibly because it's not actually him, but the audience isn't supposed to know that).

Also, Tiffany Case is an absolutely god-awful Bond girl, and her character seems to directly contradict herself: when first introduced she's shown to be sharp-witted and intelligent, but after she gets captured, she seems to lose every ounce of this and just becomes another plastic dullard without any sense.

### What about the theme tune?

Shirley Bassey returns for Diamonds Are Forever, and, whilst it's not as good as Goldfinger's, it's a pretty solid theme tune that's a lot better than her final attempt in [Moonraker](/blogalongabond/moonraker).

This silly, camp era needs a silly, camp Bond, and in [Live And Let Die](/blogalongabond/live-and-let-die) we're sure as hell going to get one of those.

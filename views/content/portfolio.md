# This is what I do

###### I provide software solutions across all platforms to the world's biggest brands and organisations

I specialise in developing apps and app-like experiences for the web, but I am completely full-stack across a wide variety of technologies. Although I a primarily a JavaScript developer I have extensive professional experience in many languages, including but not limited to Java, Objective-C, PHP, SQL, C#, ASP and Ruby. 

Clients include **The United Nations**, **BT**, **Conde Nast**, **Swarovski**, **M&uuml;ller**, **National Grid**, **PwC**, **Banque Pictet &amp; Cie**, **Gap 360** and many more.

Some demos will, eventually, be shown below...

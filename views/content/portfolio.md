# This is what I do

I provide software solutions across all platforms to the world's biggest brands and organisations.

I specialise in developing apps and app-like experiences for the web, but I am completely full-stack across a wide variety of technologies. Although I a primarily a JavaScript developer I have extensive professional experience in many languages, including but not limited to Java, Objective-C, PHP, SQL, C#, ASP and Ruby.

# This is who I am

###### Multi-disciplined software engineer, Dachshund owner and Bond enthusiast.

Hello! My name is __Dec__. Thanks for visiting my site. I'm twenty-something, for a few more years at least. I've spent the last 5 years living and working in London, England, after spending my entire life up until that point in Kent.

I'm a simple man with simple tastes. I like football, video games, and beer. I have a somewhat unhealthy obsession with the James Bond franchise, which caused me to join an Internet-wide phenomenon* known as Blogalongabond, in which I and ~20 other bloggers wrote about each individual Bond film back-to-back for almost 2 years.

**Lie*

The best way to get to know me is to read my blog, which is extensive and poorly written but I hope entertaining enough to keep your interest for a few moments. If you're more interested in my professional skillset, please checkout my [portfolio](/portfolio).
 
If you want to get in touch, the best place to get my attention is via [email](mailto:declantyson@hotmail.co.uk). Regardless of your intentions, please enjoy your stay.

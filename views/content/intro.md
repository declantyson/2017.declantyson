# Hello.

Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the price of a town called Bel-Air.

In West Philidelphia, born and raised, on the playground is how I spent most of my days. Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool, shooting some b-ball outside of the school - when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood! I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said "You're moving with your auntie and your uncle in Bel-Air."

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "Fresh" and there were dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it, yo home to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie "Yo homes, smell ya later." I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the price of Bel-Air.

###### This is what I have to say

From time to time, I like to write. I don't do it even close as often as I would like to, nor is it of any real quality, and very few people actually ever read it, but I still do it. Why? Who knows. It's a question for the ages.

Anyway, from here you can see my blogs. You may be wondering where they all are, if you were one of the few previous visitors. The answer is that the transition to my new website was rather hurried and I did not have the time to insert them into the new format (see [here](/blog/update-2017)).

They're also being groomed and edited, so I'm just keeping my favourites in here for now. Don't you worry, more will arrive. Eventually...

###### This is what I have to say

From time to time, I like to write. I don't do it even close as often as I would like to, nor is it of any real quality, and very few people actually ever read it, but I still do it. Why? Who knows. It's a question for the ages.

You may be wondering where they all are. Well, the transition to my new website was rather hurried and I did not have the time to insert them into the new format. Additionally, they're being groomed and edited, so the site is a little lightweight right now. More blogs - both new and old - will appear here eventually.

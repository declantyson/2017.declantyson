# The 2018 Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

For various reasons, 2018 was a big steaming pile of camel shit. But, instead of wasting my time depressing myself and others with my life problems, let's focus on the good things, shall we? And maybe - just maybe - 2019 will be the year I write more than four blogs! (But probs not, lol)

## Album of the Year, 2018

2018 actually saw a shockingly large amount of good music and it'd take quite a while to cover everything here, but let's just go through the highlights. _Superorganism_'s debut self-titled album is eccentric, eclectic and has some absolute bangers on it, although it doesn't take top spot as there are a few tracks on there that just lack a little bit. After an excellent EP a couple of years back, _VHS Collection - Futurism_ is a great listen too, if a little less experimental. _CHVRCHES - Love Is Dead_ was a bit poppier than their previous efforts, and perhaps a little too much so, but was stll a good listen. Oh, and _DevilDriver - Outlaws 'Til The End_ is absolutely incredible - country and metal goes awesome together.

I was left with a little bit of blue balls too - _Bastille_ teased their new album _Doom Days_ with the lead single "Quarter Past Midnight" all the way back in May, but instead of releasing the damn thing just kept putting out random collaborations and B-sides in an attempt to plug the gap. And _As I Lay Dying_ returned with _My Own Grave_, which is possibly my favourite ever song by them - an on-the-nose confession of Lambesis' regret - but with no news of a new album anytime soon I'm not going to hold out too much hope.

The best album, though, was one I noted as a contender early on in the year - it's [Machine Head - Catharsis](/blog/catharsis). I saw them live shortly after album release and they put on one hell of a show. It's not as good as _The Blackening_, but it's still a brilliant album.


## Game of the Year, 2018

So let's get the big shock out of the way - _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ is not my game of the year.

This is not because there's anything inherently wrong with the game, nor is it worse than Smash 4 (it's much, much better), but it's just because **_Rimworld_** is an absolute masterpiece. It's technically not a release from this year but it came out of early access, and I'm the dictator of this here blog so what I say goes.

_Rimworld_ is the kind of game that I've been looking for for a long time. It's got a huge amount of depth, provides a reasonable amount of challenge but still allows you to use the game to relax, and through the huge network of modding and an inventive, supportive community, gives you the chance to create your own unique stories over and over again. I invested a fair amount of my own time into a "gentrification" mod - not one I'll ever release (although you can have it if you want I guess), but just so I could turn this desolate wasteland into a middle-class suburb with a Starbucks, a Waitrose and full-sized houses. It has had so much love poured into it throughout the years from both its community and developer that it's completely worthy of the DEC award.

That being said - _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ is absolutely fucking incredible and it was a very, very tight run race. There'll be more Smash content to come on my blog shortly, that's to be sure.

## Film of the Year, 2018

Once again, comic book films dominated 2018 cinema with varying quality. _Avengers: Infinity War_ did a very good job of bringing the MCU together intensely and dramatically, setting up the story nicely for the final chapter this year. 

Perhaps controversially I wasn't crazily impressed by _Black Panther_ - the titular character was one of my favourite characters in _Civil War_, and so I was very excited, but a weak villain and lack of any real threat made the experience just a little bit... meh. I also feel that although they somewhat understandably pushed the political aspect of it, it was a tad overdone. In an ideal world (which, unfortunately, we don't live in) his race would be completely irrelevant. I went in hoping to see a superhero who just happened to be black, but that's not what the film is. It's a long way from a bad film, but it has flaws.

I thoroughly enjoyed _Venom_ although I can see how the tone doesn't sit well with some. The less said about _Aquaman_ the better.

Moving on to non-comic films, Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick star in _A Simple Favor_, a film which can't quite decide what tone it wants to follow - straddling the line between _Gone Girl_ and _Hot Fuzz_ - but ends up being incredibly entertaining.

But my favourite film of the year was _Isle of Dogs_. With its incredibly stylish flair and heartwarming story, Wes Anderson has produced a classic.

## TV Series of the Year, 2018

![FIFA World Cup 2018](/assets/awards/2018/fifa-world-cup.jpg)

To be honest I'm struggling to remember what TV I watched over the course of the past year; it's been relatively quiet - next year looks much more exciting in general for television. The year finished off strongly with _You_, a series which makes you weirdly sympathise with a psychopathic stalker - although I found the ending cliffhanger a bit forced and they could have taken a different direction, but, whatever.
  
_Bojack Horseman_ and _Archer_ both enjoyed good seasons too, although neither were exactly the strongest. _Archer_'s formula has diverged so drastically from it's best point that it is effectively an entirely different show now - the next season is set in space, and it is supposed to be the final season, but I feel like it needs one more set in the real world in which Archer wakes up to properly put the series to bed.

The winner of this DEC Award though goes to the England football team and their incredible run in the **_FIFA World Cup_**. It's not often that we get something to celebrate, and I've never been prouder of my country's football - we played very well and although I'm disappointed we couldn't go one step further, beating Colombia on penalties was the most elated I've ever felt watching the sport, to the point where I rugby-tackled my wife to the ground in joy. Plus, it was actually a great World Cup on top of that.

What? That's not a TV series? Fuck you, it's my blog and I say it is.
 
## Looking forward to in 2019...

![Game of Thrones Finale](/assets/awards/2018/game-of-thrones-finale.jpg)

Well, there's actually quite a bit. From a gaming perspective, there's still _Death Stranding_ to come out - development taking a long time, as one would expect from a Kojima game - _Metroid Prime 4_, and _The Last of Us Part II_. The problem is I'm not convinced _any_ of these games are going to make the cut for this year.

In film, there's obviously _Avengers: Endgame_ which will hopefully tie everything up in a nice big bundle, and also the live action remake of _The Lion King_. Early 2019 also has new albums from _Bastille_, _Children of Bodom_, _In Flames_ and _Soilwork_, so the music front looks promising too.

It's TV that looks most exciting though - a new series of 2017 DEC nominee _Big Little Lies_, another round of _Peaky Blinders_, and most exciting of all is the final series of **_Game of Thrones_**. I've been waiting a long time for this and I was hoping to have read GRRM's version before it came to this - but I'm thankful that, one way or another, I'll actually get to see an ending to the best epic fantasy series of my generation.

---

So, despite 2018 being shit personally, it was pretty delicious and excellent from the other side of things. I'm hopeful 2019 will bring better fortune in my life, and of course despite the high quality of creative output from the world this year, I am always hopeful for there to be more. And next year, we'll have had a full decade of DEC awards! Amazing.

Peace!

# The 2017 Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

2017 was an extremely big year in my life. I married my best friend and traveled South Africa with her. The preparation and work for this severely dented my ability to provide you all with my (usually outstanding) amount of content so I only managed a meagre 5 blogs throughout the whole year. But, things will change! Maybe. In any case - it's time to award the most Delicious and Excellent Concepts of 2017.

## Album of the Year, 2017

2017 was a bit of an odd one for music - my year's playlist on Spotify was much longer than any other, but there's not really been many full albums that have stood out. A lot of the music I have been listening to has come from sountracks - most notably the excellent soundtrack to _The Tick_, which was originally brought to my attention by Bastille's cover of Basket Case by Green Day, but also introduced me to some great new bands like New Politics, The Griswolds and Vinyl Theatre. 

There were some good releases, though. Nine Inch Nails followed up last year's nominee EP _Not The Actual Events_ with another decent EP, _Add Violence_, but it was not as good as its predecessor. All That Remains found a return to form with _Madness_, a much harder album than they've done for a long time (with the exception of one or two songs), and their best effort since the untouchable _The Fall of Ideals_.

The best release this year for me though was _**Imagine Dragons - Evolve.**_ It's a great album and easily their best to date - their sound has matured and they seem to have really cultivated a niche for themselves, and there's not really any song on the album that feels like filler.
 

## Game of the Year, 2017

This year, there weren't tonnes of great games. But holy shit, the great games that there were are absolutely unbelievable.

I'm not going to beat around the bush - the winner is of course _**[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](/blog/breath-of-the-wild)**_, which as I've previously mentioned, may be the best game I've _ever_ played. Since reviewing the Wii U version I've obtained a Nintendo Switch, and didn't hesitate to buy it again - firstly because I've now sold my Wii U and don't feel like I could be without this game in my collection, and secondly because the only thing better than playing this game is playing it on the go. 

But I've already spoken in depth about that, so instead I want to talk about the other nominees here. Firstly, another Nintendo Switch game, _Super Mario Odyssey_. The Mario franchise has been dwindling for a while due to Nintendo's insistence on the Wii U and 3DS of pushing the 2.5D games - which, while fun, have never been as high quality as their 3D collectathons. I think the impressive thing about _Odyssey_ is that, in addition to just being insanely fun, it's pretty impressive in scope. Despite only being a 10 hour long story (which frankly is plenty long enough) each world has so much individual depth to it, and it has a huge amount of replayability. And just the overall style of it - things like the map being a travel brochure and seeing different residents as tourists across the different worlds - is just so lovingly crafted.

And then there's the PS4's flagship release for this year, _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. Due to the open world nature of the game and its similar release date it was instantly compared to Breath of the Wild, but it is actually a very different game. It doesn't reward exploration quite as much and the world doesn't feel anywhere as diverse, but the story is much more enthralling and it's just so god damn pretty - it's probably the best looking game I've ever played.

## Film of the Year, 2017

Quite a lot of good films this year, it must be said. I only got to see a handful of them but there were a few that stood out. Let's get the superhero films out of the way - they're pretty much always good entertainment if a little formulaic at times. _Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2_ was one of these - great fun, not as good as the first. _Thor: Ragnarok_ was great, but it may have been the corniest film I've ever seen. I avoided _Justice League_, but I did manage to see _Wonder Woman_, which was probably the best superhero release of the year (and unquestionably the best release in the DC Universe). I've managed to avoid watching _The Last Jedi_, but the longer I think about [The Force Awakens](/blog/the-force-awakens) the more disappointed I find myself with it, so I need to find the motivation to continue with Star Wars in general.

There were a couple of good musicals that graced our screens, too - _The Greatest Showman_ was enjoyable even if it did just follow every single standard musical trope, as Hugh Jackman proves his musical talent once more. _La La Land_ was better, even if it was notably more depressing.

Speaking of depressing, the film of the year goes to the spectacular _**Dunkirk**_. Anything based on something so utterly horrific was always going to be depressing and Christopher Nolan gives it his now-perfected assault on the eyes and ears, and even to story structure as three different strands of plot starting at different times but converging at once in a climax of emotion. An absolutely superb film.

## TV Series of the Year, 2017

![Stranger Things 2](/assets/awards/2017/stranger-things-2.jpg)

There's been some truly excellent TV series this year, mostly from the other side of the Atlantic. Let's kick off with the usual suspect _[Game of Thrones](/blog/game-of-thrones-s7)_. The penultimate season is simultaneously the strongest and weakest yet - it has some absolutely sensational moments but they're suffocated a little by the rushed pacing and often questionable character decisions. HBO also released a new mini-series _Big Little Lies_, which adopts a Fincher-esque take to Desperate Housewives - it's a short series that's well worth the watch. 

The Beeb has brought some great entertainment too, in the form of _Blue Planet 2_ and _Peaky Blinders_, the latter of which I'm still working my way through - but it is a fantastic little series.

Most of the great TV, though, once again came from Netflix. I didn't get around to watching season 5 of _House of Cards_, and the first episode of _Orange is the New Black_ was enough for me to decide I was done with that particular series, but there were several others that captured my attention. Firstly was season 4 of _Bojack Horseman_. I only recently discovered Bojack, and I soon realised that although it's billed as a comedy there is a deep underlying message to it all and this series takes it to a whole new level. It's almost therapeutic, especially to see Bojack get a little bit of a win, finally, at the end of the season as rewards for the efforts he is making to be a better person.

Then there's the controversial _13 Reasons Why_. I found it very interesting - the suicide scene, whilst causing a lot of uproar, in my opinion was pretty necessary to the series. It's a series that verges on glamorising suicide through its portrayal of Hannah's vengeance throughout the series, and by displaying the true horror of the act itself that it can perhaps deter people afterwards.

However the best series of the year is the follow up to last year's winner - it's _**Stranger Things 2**_. It wasn't quite as good as the first go round, and indeed there was that one episode that served no purpose (you know the one), but it was still a brilliant ride.
 
## Looking forward to in 2018...

![FIFA World Cup 2018](/assets/awards/2017/fifa-world-cup.jpg)

Bit of a weird one, 2018. It honestly seems like nothing's happening. There's no big exciting films. A small handful of interesting games. A new Bastille album at some point. Nothing to get overly hyped about.

In terms of films, _Black Panther_ and _Avengers: Infinity War_ will undoubtedly be a lot of fun, and there's _Isle of Dogs_ which has the potential to be excellent. But other than that, nothing grasps too much. The most exciting looking game is Kojima's weird-as-shit _Death Stranding_, although I'm still holding out hope for a Switch version of _Smash_. 

Even the winner of this award, _**The FIFA World Cup 2018**_, is a little subdued this time around. Maybe it's because I'm aware of the chances England will let me down early in the competition. Maybe it's because I'm still feeling a little sour about the manner in which the competition was awarded to Russia. But, it's still the World Cup - and there's not been a World Cup that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed in one manner or another. 

---

2017 will take some topping. I don't think 2018 will manage it, but it's still very early days. Who knows what treasures await in the year ahead? Only time will tell. Until next time!

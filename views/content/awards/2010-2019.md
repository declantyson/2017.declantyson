# The 2010s Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

Welcome, welcome, welcome to the decade-ly edition of the Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards, where we make already worthless awards even more worthless by cramming them across an arbitrarily defined period of time!

## Album of the decade

My album of the decade is **_[Bastille - Bad Blood](/blog/bad-blood)_**. On reflection over the past 10 years I've probably gained greater enjoyment from their sophomore album [Wild World](/blog/wild-world), but the fact remains that _Bad Blood_ helped shape my taste in music for the decade gone past. Passion Pit's _Gossamer_ got quite a lot of listening from me too, as well as the absolutely incredible _Masseduction_ from St. Vincent, and the other end of my musical taste spectrum was Machine Head's _Catharsis_ which was almost definitely my favourite metal album of the decade. I've been thinking about making some kind of chart to map what I feel is quite a varied musical taste. But I probably won't.

## Game of the decade

I'm not sure if it says more about me or about the gaming industry as a whole over the past 10 years, but I noted in 2010 what a difficult decision this award was for me. This time around it's not even close; **_[The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild](/blog/breath-of-the-wild)_** takes the crown with complete ease. It is an absolutely incredible game - one that I wish I could experience again for the first time - and I can only hope that the sequel can hold a candle to what I believe is a game that will go unmatched for many years to come.

Honourable mentions are _Rimworld_, a game which pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable to do, _The Last of Us_, which took the winning formula of the _Uncharted_ series and gave it one of gaming's greatest stories, _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, which truly lives up to its name as the ultimate crossover game, and also _Undertale_, which is one of the most unique games I have ever played and I hope to see more of this kind of bravery in future.
						 
## Film of the decade

It was a decade dominated by Marvel and for good reason - they put out a lot of truly great, truly enjoyable films, but the two top contenders for me are not superhero films. I really went back and forth on this decision (although that implies I spent longer than 10 minutes throwing this blog together rather than just realising "shit, I was supposed to write it 2 weeks ago") but ultimately my film of the decade is **_[The Wolf of Wall Street](/blog/wolf-of-wall-street)_**. It has everything - great performances, a villainous protagonist, gratuitous sex and drug abuse and is just an all-round fantastic film. The very close second was _[Inception](/blog/inception)_, which was a more inventive film, perhaps, but suffers a little bit from overcomplicating itself. It has led to one of cinema's great questions over whether the top fell or not - one that should never be answered. 

> Editor's note: I clearly ran out of motivation for this one, again. 2020-2029 will be better.

# The 2000s Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

We're at the end of another decade. So, in the past ten years, what's been the best?

## Album of the decade

2003 saw Children of Bodom break away from the underground metal world and into public view with their stunning album **_Hate Crew Deathroll_**. To date, it stands as one of my favourite albums of all time, shortly behind Nine Inch Nails' _The Downward Spiral_. Other worthy mentions were Slipknot's _All Hope Is Gone_, Machine Head's _The Blackening_ and AILD's _An Ocean Between Us_.

## Game of the decade

This is a very, very difficult decision. There have been so many fantastic games over the last decade as the gaming industry has truly flourished. However, my decision is **_Super Smash Bros. Melee_**. Although I sort of prefer _Brawl_'s increased roster and content, it didn't have the same impact when it came out as _Melee_. Other games that deserve note are the fantastic _Pikmin_, all of the instalments in the [Zelda series](/blog/zelda-special), _Conker's Bad Fur Day_ (believe it or not, it came out in 2001!), _Halo_ (the original, all others can go suck it), _Timesplitters 2_, _Eternal Darkness_, _Fallout 3_, _Little Big Planet_, _Burnout Paradise_, and many, many more.
						 
## Film of the decade

Another difficult decision, but it quite simply has to be **_The Dark Knight_**. Flawed though it was in places, the characters were fantastic and really drew you in to the mythology that DC Comics wants: not cheesy and camp, but very dark and sinister. Fantastic film.

> Editor's note: I clearly ran out of motivation for this one. 2010-2019 will be better.

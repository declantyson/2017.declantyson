# The 2019 Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

In the 2018 DEC Awards I proposed that 2019 may be the year I write more than four blogs. I instead wrote three. But I'm still doing the awards! That's something, right? Right??

## Album of the Year, 2019

Music was honestly the main concept that was delicious and excellent in 2019. With new albums from _As I Lay Dying_, Bastille_, _Biffy Clyro_, _Children of Bodom_, _Demon Hunter_, In Flames_, _Slipknot_, _Rammstein_ and _Mumford & Sons_ there was plenty to choose from throughout the year.

I'd been waiting a long time for _Bastille - Doom Days_ and it is a truly excellent album but for me it doesn't quite hit the same heights as _Wild World_ - although the extended edition is absolutely brilliant. _As I Lay Dying - Shaped By Fire_ answered my prayers of last season's awards for a new album, but although it was good, last year's single _My Own Grave_ remains the best song on it by some distance.

_Rammstein_'s self-titled album - and most likely their last - apexes with lead single _Deutschland_, and _Children of Bodom - Hexed_ is an excellent swansong album for a band that were the soundtrack to my youth. But the winner of the final DEC Album of the Year of the decade is a bit of an outsider. **_Bon Iver - i,i_** ticks all the boxes of being super weird but also compellingly accessible, and it's the first album of theirs I've really attempted to properly listen to and it's an artistic triumph.

## Game of the Year, 2019

I played staggeringly few games in 2019 and there are still many on my list - so don't be surprised if this award gets retrospectively re-awarded. The full list of games released in 2019 that I played are as follows:

- _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_
- _The Outer Worlds_
- _Cadence of Hyrule_

I guess I've got space for some mini-reviews here of the two games I haven't covered. _FE:3H_ is a decent game, but it's far from the best _Fire Emblem_. The supporting cast is probably the best mix of classic FE tropes out of all the FE games I've played, but the combat is frankly a little too simple (even without the incredibly overpowered rewind tactic). The supporting lore of the story is very good as well, but the actual main storyline leaves a little to be desired, with Edelgard's actions not really matching her motivations too much. It's an interesting take on things though and it's good that you can see different angles of the war, being much less black and white than a typical good/evil struggle - each party has their own positive and negative deeds.

_The Outer Worlds_ is a classic RPG in the same vein as Fallout or Elder Scrolls, with rich characters and an interesting setting, and a surprisingly good sense of humour. It's quite heavily interaction focused, which is nice and seeing the way your companions interact with the other characters in the game is entertaining and absorbing. Its main weakness for me is that there's much less to see than you may expect. It's a game that would massively benefit from being open world and focusing more on exploration, but it's still a very good game.

That leave **_[Cadence of Hyrule](/blog/cadence-of-hyrule)_** and frankly I'm more than happy to give it the DEC Game of the Year for 2019. I think it's a game that will probably get overlooked by many, but it's a truly, truly special game and something that I'd recommend everybody play through at least once.

## Film of the Year, 2019

![Joker](/assets/awards/2019/joker.png)

Honestly, I'm not going to dwell too much on cinema this year. It's been average at best, with Marvel topping the charts repeatedly, and as much as I enjoyed _Avengers: Endgame_ I don't think it was as good as _Infinity War_ and I think it's come at the right time as the genre is reaching breaking point.

_Once Upon A Time In Hollywood_ is a Tarantino film, always good, always controversial, and just like _Inglourious Basterds_ subverts history into a different world. It's great. 

But I still think **_[Joker](/blog/joker)_** is probably the most important piece of cinema this year, if not the decade. Society is slowly but surely making the shift into accepting and treating mental heath seriously, and this film is a reflection of what happens when we don't.

## TV Series of the Year, 2019

![You](/assets/awards/2019/you.jpg)

Let's get the obvious out of the way - it's not [Game of Thrones](/blog/game-of-thrones-s8). I definitely wasn't as disappointed as the vast majority of people with the finale but there is no denying the obvious drop in quality to rush through to the end.

Season 3 of _Stranger Things_ is, in my opinion, an improvement on the second, although there is a clear shift towards being more light-hearted and I'm a little disappointed they recycled the Mind Flayer instead of introducing a new monster. 

_Archer: 1999_ was definitely the best of the "spinoff" series, but the best thing to come out of that season is that the motherfucker is finally awake and we can get back to some kind of normality from next season onwards.

My favourite series of the year is actually **_You_** which I briefly mentioned last year - I was a bit skeptical of the cliffhanger at the end of Season 1 but my skepticism was misplaced as it actually lead to delivering a well-paced, tense and interesting season, ending with a twist I genuinely didn't see coming and one of the best episodes of television I've seen for a while in Episode 8 "Fear and Loathing in Beverly Hills".


## Looking forward to in 2020...

![Euro 2020](/assets/awards/2019/euro-2020.jpg)

Maybe _The Last of Us Part II_ will finally get released, that'd be nice. Also an outside hope that the sequel to _Breath of the Wild_ will appear, although I'm not really expecting that.

There is of course _No Time To Die_, which will briefly bring back Blogalongabond, although after the meh-fest that was [Spectre](/blogalongabond/spectre) I'm reigning in my expectations just a little. Equal skepticism is being laid towards _Bill & Ted Face The Music_, which will either be amazing, or terrible.

However I'm very excited for **_Euro 2020_** and it's coming-homeness - if anyone's got any spare Wembley tickets, hit me up!!!

It's the end of the decade, and guess what that means? It means that there are DEC Awards to be handed out for the most Delicious and Excellent concepts over the last 10 years. Exciting, right? I mean, not really, a decade is just an arbitrary period of time and I could equally have done it from 2006-2015 and reasonably counted anything within those 10 years as a decade. But humans are a species obsessed with neat, tidy round numbers, so I guess we have to settle with the 2010s. 

They're not ready yet, but watch this space. They'll be here before the end of January.

# The 2010 Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

While I have a little bit of time to spare at University today, I thought I'd take a look back at the last year in my area of interests in the Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards of 2010 (I am fully aware of how incredibly crap the title is, but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn).

## Album of the Year, 2010

2010 had a lot to live up to after the fantastic year that preceded it that saw the likes of Passion Pit and The Prodigy grace our ears. It has lived up to and perhaps exceeded the standard set before it, with fantastic albums that I reviewed on this website (such as Bullet For My Valentine's [_Fever_](/blog/catching-the-fever) and As I Lay Dying's [_The Powerless Rise_](/blog/the-powerless-rise)) and those I didn't, such as The Naked And Famous' _Passive Me, Aggressive You_, and the winner - **_Pendulum - Immersion_**. A fantastic band with two already fantastic albums, they continue to improve and pave the way as the leading sound of Drum and Bass/Rock fusion.

## Game of the Year, 2010

This is a difficult choice. There have been games of outstanding quality this year, some brilliant surprises and some lacklustre disappointments. In the latter category is [Final Fantasy XIII](/blog/going-rpg-crazy), which, while still a great game, failed to deliver the scope and brilliance of previous games in the series.

Moving swiftly on and focusing on the positives, though, the shortlist includes the immersive [Heavy Rain](/blog/heavy-rain), which would probably have won if it had a little  more replayability, and Fallout: New Vegas (which is basically Fallout 3 set in Vegas, so immediately it's going to be extremely high up). I would love to give the award to LittleBigPlanet 2, which is absolutely fantastic, but that's a 2011 game and so will probably win the award this time next year. However the winner for 2010 is **_Gran Turismo 5_**, an absolutely superb racing game which incorporates both simulation and arcade elements perfectly, coupled with truly astonishing graphics, and a sense of realism unmatched by any other driving simulator to date.
		
## Film of the Year, 2010

After the appalling mess that was 2009 in film, 2010 was much brighter. It wasn't just limited to the summer blockbusters, either. _Kick-Ass_ was a brilliant tribute to comic book heroes, _Dinner For Schmucks_ and _The Other Guys_ were refreshingly stupid comedies, and Tim Burton provided us with his take on _Alice In Wonderland_. Then there was _Toy Story 3_, a fantastic end to possibly the best trilogy of films ever, and the not-so-good-but-still-incredibly-entertaining _Machete_ and _The Expendables_. But - of course - the award goes to **_[Inception](/blog/inception)_** which has already staked its claim for best film of the 2010s. It's a truly special film that will, deservedly, go down in history.
				
## Looking forward to in 2011...

![Skyward Sword](/assets/awards/2010/skyward-sword.png)

Coming up soon is _Portal 2_, which I have no doubt will be simply incredible. The first _Portal_ game took a tired FPS genre and injected it with puzzles that make you think, and a brilliant sort of mini-story to boot - the cake is a lie. _LittleBigPlanet 2_ - although I already own it, is technically this year - is a fantastic game that already owns everything that came out last year. _Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception_ promises to take the brilliance of _Uncharted 2_ and build and improve upon it. My game of 2009, _Arkham Asylum_, is expecting a sequel in the form of _Arkham City_. But topping all of these, making me sick like a child is **_[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword](/blog/skyward-sword)_**. Before too long I will do a [feature on the Zelda series and just why I love it so much](/blog/zelda-special), and why I think that Skyward Sword may finally replace Ocarina of Time in my heart as the best game ever.

# The 2009 Delicious and Excellent Concept Awards

Yes, it's the inaugral and not-very-long awaited DEC awards (Delicious and Excellent Concepts)! I'm your host, Declan Tyson (unsurprisingly, seeing as it's my website and awards ceremony) and I couldn't care less about being here, but honestly I'm bored and the PlayStation's overheated - I blame Fallout.

## Album of the Year, 2009

And the award goes to... The Prodigy for their fantastic album **_Invaders Must Die_**! Highlights from this album include their spectacular rave-rock-dance anthem _Omen_ and stripper song _Stand Up_. In all honesty, there wasn't really anything close. I mean, this year has As I Lay Dying's _The Powerless Rise_, which should be immense, but other than that, music seems to have died.

## Game of the Year, 2009

This award is considerably more difficult. There have been many good games in 2009, but not really any amazing ones. I mean up there are _Wii Sports Resort_, _New Super Mario Bros Wii_, _Mini Ninjas_ and _The Sims 3_, all of which are games that I would give 8 out of 10 but no more. However, coming in first place to clinch victory, is **_Batman: Arkham Asylum_**. Although somewhat linear and perhaps a little short, the stunning graphics and excellent combat system keeps you wanting more and has really whet my appetite for the second one this year. Congratulations to Rocksteady, certainly the breakthrough developer of the year.

## Film of the Year, 2009

**_Inglourious Basterds_**. Nothing else was even close. A bad year for film, in all honesty.

## Looking forward to in 2010...

Well, where to start? There's AILD's _[The Powerless Rise](/blog/the-powerless-rise)_ to come soon, _Sonic The Hedgehog 4_ which everyone's dubious about because it almost seems too good to be true, _Fallout: New Vegas_, and Tim Burton's _Alice In Wonderland_. However, the thing I am looking forward to most in 2010 is coming out on March 9th, although I won't be getting it for months - it's **_[Final Fantasy XIII](/blog/going-rpg-crazy)_**. The first next-gen Final Fantasy has taken a while coming, but I have absolutely no doubt that it will be worth every glorious minute.

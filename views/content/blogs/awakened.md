###### As I Lay Dying compress a decade of metalcore into one superb album

#### 10th December 2012

**Since I wrote this review frontman Tim Lambesis has been arrested for paying someone to murder his wife, with fairly conclusive evidence. I'd like to point out my appreciation of his musicianship does not transfer to an apparently steroid-fueled crime.**

As I Lay Dying's latest effort doesn't waste any time, leading into a breakneck thrash track that, frankly, beats the shit out of every track on _The Powerless Rise_. _Cauterize_ is an absolute quality track, even if it's not one of their most catchy - the chorus of 'I'm caught between the feeling of being pulled apart of stuffed into a cell' just doesn't roll as well as some of the melodies they've previously blasted out. _A Greater Foundation_ continues this incredibly high tempo, and decides to basically turn the song into one huge breakdown, with a very Killswitch-esque melodic breakdown towards the end of the song.

This classic metalcore style is something that continues throughout the album. Maybe they were aware that the thrash route on _The Powerless Rise_ was a bit weaker - and certainly less suited to Tim Lambesis' voice than pure metalcore - and it's something they've very much rectified here. Whilst _A Greater Foundation_ could be a Killswitch Engage song, _Resilience_ is something that sounds like it was a missing track on their own _An Ocean Between Us_ (only a good thing). _Wasted Words_ is closer to their _Frail Words Collapse_ sound, and is also similar thematically - 'All the wasted words I said/In all the cities that I left' echoes _Elegy_ in more ways than one, but it also draws elements from Chimaira's eastern-inspired tuning.

It's traditional for an As I Lay Dying album to have a 'slow' song on it (that's still insanely heavy) and the first minute of _Overcome_ tricks you into thinking it's going to be that, before it slams on the gas and rips your ears out in a hailstorm of steel riffs. It shares a name with one of All That Remains' albums (one of the poor ones, post _Fall of Ideals_) and at some points you almost think you are listening to All That Remains, with Lambesis emulating Phil Labonte's vocals, and the guitars sound SO much like that found on _The Fall Of Ideals_. The following two tracks, _No Lungs To Breathe_ and _Defender_, also feels very ATR-ey, although later ATR (so not quite as good).

The actual 'slow' song on the album isn't even that slow, and it's saved until the very end in _Tear Out My Eyes_. It's a good song, but the strength of a song like _Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Soldier_ is it's strong lyrics, and forgive me, but 'Before I tear out my eyes/I'll just admit they're part of me' is not the best example of this band's songwriting.

Of course, like every album - and metal albums in particular - there are some songs that will just become background noise compared to the other standout tracks. One of those tracks is _Whispering Silence_, which is the song that tries to emulate the sound that they adopted on TPR. But this is one out of many, and the many are very good. 

Before the final two tracks, we have a short, calm, instrumental called _Washed Away_, which prepares us for the most classic As I Lay Dying track on the album: _My Only Home_. It perfectly blends the melodies introduced in _Shadows Are Security_ with the riffing found on _An Ocean Between Us_ and using the unusual song structure found on _Frail Words Collapse_, and then it bursts into an incredible breakdown that you'd find on _Beneath The Encasing of Ashes_. This is my personal favourite song on the album.

Basically, do you like metalcore? Because this is mostly a compilation of all the different styles of metalcore that have emerged over the past decade and printed in one nostalgia-filled disc. It'll take a few listens for me to really know where it stands compared to their previous albums, but quite simply, it's bloody fantastic.

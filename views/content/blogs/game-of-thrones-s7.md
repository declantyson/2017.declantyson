# Game of Thrones Season 7

###### More dragons. More drama. Less sense.

#### 1st September 2017

**The following is a review of the seventh series of Game of Thrones and as such will contain spoilers. If you don't like that, turn back. It will also contain book spoilers.**

I don't think there's any denying since the book material dried up, _Game of Thrones_ has suffered. The dialogue has lost all of it subtlety, interesting character development scenes have been dropped for the sake of fan service, and perhaps most importantly, everything feels like it's rushing towards the endgame at the expense of sense.

The thing is, most of this has been self-imposed by the limitation of 7 episodes this time around. We're now very close to the end, and there is simply too much to wrap up in such a short space of time. The beauty of GRRM's creation is the amazing world he has created; it's a world in which - despite the 1.7 million+ words written - you're fully aware that you're only seeing a small part of Planetos, which carries on ticking around the main plot, bit by bit, step by step. In series 7, _GoT_ has basically decided: fuck all that, everything revolves around the characters you see, and the rest of the world can wait on the sidelines.

Take the very first scene of the series, for example. We're supposed to believe that 4 years after the fact, House Frey is still celebrating the victory over Robb Stark at the Red Wedding. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a great scene when Arya murders the entire house - but it's this kind of weird shit that pervades throughout the entire season, making it seem a little lazy. And what about Ghost? Jon's faithful direwolf, waiting on the sidelines at Winterfell - he did not make a single appearance this season and I'm not sure he was even mentioned.

There are some pretty big positives to the season that contain some of the best dramatic moments and intense battle scenes to date - but the biggest issues are the decisions and plans that ride up to those plot points. The biggest offender is by far the "plan" to capture a wight. I can accept that this is a world of magic where the rules are little bit flexible but there comes a point where it reallllly stretches the suspension of disbelief.
 
It's pretty clear that the major event this season was going to be the Night's King taking a dragon for himself. For that, the dragons somehow need to get beyond the Wall. I would not at all be surprised if this is the very reason that GRRM has taken so damn long over _The Winds of Winter_, because it's not an easy event to put together. Even when Dany lands in Westeros, she's thousands of miles away from the Wall. So, let's recap how D&D have done it:

- Tyrion - an intelligent man - suggests a plan to prove to the most stubborn woman in the world that she should do something extremely against her interests. 
- The plan relies on getting a single wight alone so they can capture it, despite the fact that every single encounter with them has involved hundreds of wights and many, many people dying.
- Somehow they manage to get a very small group alone, kill the White Walker leading them, who happened to have "turned" every single wight that was with him, except - conveniently - for one
- They are then cornered by a significantly larger group of wights in the middle of a frozen lake. The ice cracks, forming a moat. Oh, the wights can't swim now. 
- Now here's where it gets really ridiculous. At the start of the attack they sent Gendry back to Eastwatch to send a raven to Daenerys, trying to get her to help them. There's two options here:
    - Gendry, the Raven and Daenerys managed to travel over a thousand combined miles overnight to save them
    - The process took a few days longer than shown and the guys on the lake managed to survive several nights in subzero temperatures without succumbing to dehydration or starvation (with the exception of bear-mauled Thoros, RIP), the lake re-freezing and still being in good enough shape to fight off hundreds of zombies. Yeah, not exactly much better.
- When the dragon's defeated, it falls into the water. Later on the wights attached chains to it to drag it out of the wa- wait, I thought they couldn't swim? LITERALLY ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS NOT HAVE THE DRAGON DROWN FOR THIS PLOT POINT TO MAKE SENSE FFS

It's a real shame because with more thought, love and attention this could so very easily be the best series of the programme yet. Daenerys riding her dragon into battle is incredible, the moment where the Night's King brings down the wall, Littlefinger finally getting what he deserves and the revelation of Jon's true name... and that's just the pinnacle. The direction the story has taken is fantastic. The path it's taken to get there, less so. 

I'm just worried that they're going to rush the last season and leave too much hanging. Even when the series is done, there's no way I won't read the books. I want to see what GRRM has planned for the world, and I just hope to the Seven Gods that he manages to finish them all.

# Wild World

###### The follow up to an album that changed my taste in music

#### 12th October 2016

When Bastille dropped their first album in the spring of 2013, I was undergoing a bit of a musical transition. Heavy metal/metalcore had long been my music of choice, but I was starting to move away from that somewhat into the rather hipster world of indietronica, where bands replace vowels with the letter V and begin their songs with samples of niche 70's B-movies. Hearing *Pompeii* was the catalyst, really, for my music taste to shift further to the electropop spectrum. Although I do still listen to metal regularly, it's not really the majority of what I listen to anymore.

*Bad Blood* was my [album of the year for 2013](/awards/2013), and to be honest it's not really been bettered since then. It's an album I find myself putting back on regularly, so I was very excited for the follow-up. What I got wasn't as strong as the first album, and on first listen through I was even a little disappointed, but I've grown to love it with a few more playthroughs. There's definitely a bit of a polarity between songs I enjoy and songs I don't so much, though - and it's almost invariably the slow songs that are weaker.

Lead single *Good Grief* follows the formula of *Pompeii*, by disguising what are actually very downbeat lyrics with a catchy, upbeat tempo. It's not quite as dark as ash-ridden corpses, but it's still ultimately a sad song about the death of a loved one and trying to come to terms with grief - even putting a positive spin on it. Quite literally, good grief.

There's heavy use of distorted bass throughout the whole album, and it works pretty well, giving it a unique sound - *The Currents* and *Warmth*, two of my favourite songs on the record, both display this very well. 

The problem definitely arrives when they try to go more ballad-y - I'm really not a fan of &An Act of Kindness* or *Two Evils*, although I can't quite put my finger on why. It's not that Dan Smith's voice isn't suited to that type of singing, but it's just better suited at the more pop-orientated tracks. The main problem is that the whole of *Wild World* is a bit slower-paced than *Bad Blood* - which means there's less of it I enjoy.

*Send Them Off!* is probably my favourite song this time out, which starts with a sample ("It was a slight on my honour, so he deserved it... but we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world has ever seen!") from apparently terrible Italian 70's sci-fi flick [Cosmos: War of the Planets](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149677/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) - and like I said, this is basically what my music taste has become.

*Wild World* won't have as much of an impact on my personal music taste as *Bad Blood* did, but I'm already finding myself putting it on quite often. I don't love it in the same way, but it's going to keep me happy for a while - and with a wide variety of remixes coming out seemingly every day, it's going to have a fair bit of longevity.

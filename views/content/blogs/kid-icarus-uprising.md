# Kid Icarus: Uprising

###### Unique and fun but marred by slightly frustrating controls

#### 24th April 2012

I have to admit that I was amongst the majority that had never heard of Pit or _Kid Icarus_ before _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_. The two games prior to the latest installment, released on the NES and Game Boy respectively, went relatively unnoticed compared to Nintendo's other flagships. Despite this, the latest outing in the series was pretty much the game that made me want a 3DS, and it's lived up to the expectations that I set it.

_Kid Icarus: Uprising_ is a frantic, fast-paced and brilliantly entertaining action game, with the old mantra "simple to learn, impossible to master" at the forefront throughout the entire game. However, the first thing I recommend doing when you boot up the software is changing the controls, as using the touch screen to aim gives you cramp within a few minutes. I use A/B/Y/X but I can imagine that the Circle Pad Pro is pretty well suited to this game.

Each level is split into three distinct sections: an on-rails air level akin to _Lylat Wars_, an on-foot level and a boss, which can be either of the aforementioned. Both of these are equally challenging, but the parts where you are not restricted by a flight path are considerably more fun, which is good, as they are invariably the longer parts of the level. The multiplayer takes place all on foot and is a great blast, adding more longevity to what is already a surprisingly big game.

The graphics design and game features, if not done by the Brawl team, are heavily influenced by it. The menu is nigh on identical and half of the options are directly lifted from that game. There's also a very deep weapon customisation system that's very much like a fantasy version of that found in _Borderlands_.

Although the gameplay can be a little repetitive, it never stops being fun, and although the anime take on Greek mythology coupled with odd Japanese humour may put off some people, I personally find it quite endearing.

Put simply, Uprising is the best game Iâ€™ve played so far this year.

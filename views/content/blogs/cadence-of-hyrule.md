# Cadence of Hyrule

###### A wonderful little game that stands tall alongside mainline entries in the Zelda series

#### 21st August 2019

So it's been a little while. I had actually intended on writing this one around 6 weeks ago, but, you know, life and  all that.

I was immediately excited when I heard about _Cadence of Hyrule_. I had already played a fair amount of _Crypt of the Necrodancer_ on PC, and was considering purchasing the Switch version at some point anyway, but the announcement of the Zelda theme made me put that plan on the backburner. It helped that one of the few YouTubers I actually subscribe to, the insanely talented [FamilyJules](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9ez6CnUQCFEUnxeBGlR9w), was to play a key role in the soundtrack, which takes classic Zelda tunes and remixes them with a chiptune/techno/dance/rock feel.

The soundtrack is everything I could possibly have wanted to be, from the very opening menu with the _Ocarina of Time_ theme being undercut by some low distorted drums, and it also brings in some classic _Crypt of the Necrodancer_ tunes too early on. And then you get thrown into the Overworld, a procedurally-generated Hyrule, which is where you'll spend most of your time. And it feels just like Hyrule - the classic Zelda enemies are scattered across the map, and they recreate their movements faithfully but with a rhythmic twist. There are four main areas to explore, each with their own dungeon. You can tackle them in any order and then at the end you'll come across a boss, whose name is a clever pun, giving you a magical instrument at the end of it.

My favourite of these is, without a doubt, the cleverly named Gleeokenspiel - a Gleeok being a 3-headed dragon from the NES _Legend of Zelda_, and it resembles a Glockenspiel. Plus, the song for this boss battle is absolutely incredible, and it synchronises up perfectly with its attacks. It's one of the most fun bosses I've fought in any game for a very long time (and it's also bone-crushingly hard, but that's not a bad thing, as I just enjoyed listening to the music repeatedly).

The main downside to this wonderful little game is that it's just a little too little. It took me around 6 hours to 100%, although I loved every second of it, and at Â£25, that's a hefty price tag for not a lot of game time. Due to the procedural generation of the worlds and dungeons, there is some replay value if you wanted to go back through it, but I feel like more content needs to be added to it in future to truly justify spending quite so much on it.

That being said - this doesn't feel like an indie, spin-off title. This feels like a true, complete Zelda game, and in terms of the quality of its production and gameplay, stands tall alongside mainline entries in the series. It's a truly fantastic game and if you can afford it I'd highly recommend it.

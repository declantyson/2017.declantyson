# Joker

###### Joker is surprisingly thought-provoking, and the backlash has pissed me off

*Spoilers, yada yada yada - I've tried to keep it vague.*

This isn't going to be a long blog, but there are some thoughts I wanted to put down.

I went into _Joker_ not really knowing exactly what to expect. Although not a DC film, anything in the post-Nolan era related to DC seems to range from below average to awful. The only thing I knew for sure was that Jaoquin Phoenix is a great actor, so he would be able to do one of cinema's most iconic characters justice. I wasn't really expecting the film to be so thought-provoking. It's not really an origin story, at least not in the same vein as most other origin stories. Instead, it is a close examination of mental illness and how society as a whole treats it.

Let's talk briefly about the violence in the film. There are calls to ban due to "gratuitous violence". This is absolute bullshit. There are 6 instances of violence in the film:

- The Joker is mugged and beaten by a group of youths.
- The Joker gets into a fight and shoots three men. 
- The Joker suffocates a woman with a pillow.
- The Joker violently stabs a man.
- The Joker shoots a man in the head.
- It is implied that the Joker kills somebody off-screen in the closing scenes.

Of these, the only one that can realistically be described as "gratuitous" is the stabbing, and even then the majority of it is off-screen, save for splattering of blood. But it is in no way glamourised. In fact, quite the opposite. We as a society have become so used to films _actually_ glamourising violence that this kind of violence is difficult to watch. It's not comic, choreographed and epic like you've got used to seeing in other comic book or action films. It's brutal, intimate and personal. But, most importantly - and this is why I think people take issue - it holds the viewer accountable.
 
When violence presented as a consequence of what society does to people instead of necessary means to an end, the shitbags in the media can't handle the responsibility. The Joker as a character is a thiny-veiled metaphor for mental illness, and literally every single character he interacts with treats him with the same disregard that society does for the mentally ill - contempt, mockery, abuse. His therapist doesn't help him, and funding is cut for mental health treatments meaning he cannot even get drugs to treat himself. All of these issues are very real problems faced by hundreds of people every day, and the whole point of violence in _Joker_ is a mirror held up to those watching it, saying "This is your doing, and fuck you for not accepting it".

Regarding the actual quality of the film itself, it's quite a slow burn, but in my opinion that's a good thing - too often with these origin stories there's too much story focus. In _Joker_ the plot is actually secondary to the character development. We see the Joker's slow descent into complete madness and the reasons for it. It finely toes the line of empathy - you certainly feel for the things he goes through but not his reactions to them, and that's almost entirely down to the quality of Phoenix's acting who is probably my favourite Joker to date. It's not a film that's for everyone - it is slow, it is dark, and ultimately it's a political statement. If you're ok with all of that, you should enjoy it.

Ironically, the press around Joker has only cemented what is ultimately a self-fulfilling prophecy. I see language being thrown around like "losers" and "loners" referring to these strawmen who will apparently go around and shoot up somewhere because they look up to the Joker. It's saddening that these people completely miss the point that - if these people do exist - they need **help** and not degradation. Get off your high horses, and support mental health instead of demonising the very idea of somebody being mentally ill. This is YOUR doing. And fuck you for not accepting it.

# Detroit: Become Human

###### A linear game, yet one that offers a lot of freedom

#### 18th June 2018

It was over eight years ago I reviewed Quantic Dream's [Heavy Rain](/blog/heavy-rain). I'm much less prolific in my blogs these days but, as I re-read the entry in preparation to have a chat about their latest release, I realise that the frequency was certainly offset by a lack of length - my blogs these days are much longer. More waffley, perhaps. I'm doing it now. I am adding nothing of substance, and I will not apologise.

Anyway, onto the game - one of the regular pitfalls of Quantic Dream's games is that their characters are a little bit too stiff and robotic in their animations, so in an incredibly self-aware attempt to combat this, they decided to make all of their main characters in _Detroit: Become Human_ literal robots. That being said, they have come on in leaps and bounds from _Heavy Rain_ and indeed from _Beyond: Two Souls_ - there's a noticeable improvement in the animations throughout and the androids become intentionally less stiff as they gradually become human throughout.

Gameplay is as we have come to expect from QD, but it's more polished than ever. It's just a shame that they _still_ can't get the hang of moving a character around naturally. It's hard to actually pinpoint why the movement is so frustrating - it could just be down to the dynamic camera angles throughout, or it could be to do with the fact that the characters move at one speed, or it could also be that there are invisible walls a good six inches away from every single wall or surface. 
 
The game does do a very good job of putting you into a world that feels open whilst being entirely linear, by embedding why you can't go down certain streets into the story as error messages in the Android's HUD. It's a small touch but one that works nicely. 

But what really sets this game apart is the way that your choices actually matter, and much more than just in the sense of whether or not your characters live or die (although that is part of it). Looking at other "Walking Simulators", which are becoming increasingly popular these days, very few of them affect the way the story plays out in the same way that _Detroit_ does. Minor interactions open up complete new paths later on in the game. Subtle details like where you choose to spend the night change entire chapters. You can access flowcharts of all of the possible routes you can take - it would take a very long time to finish them all.

Moving onto the story and it's by far and away QD's best effort. _Heavy Rain_'s theme appealed to me more - a dark, semi-futuristic noire serial killer story - but it ruined it with a poor twist that didn't really make any sense. _Detroit_ follows no such nonsense with a much more to-the-point and straightforward setting, with heavy references to apartheid and nazism, with all the subtlety of an elephant fart.

It works, though - although I do question the decision to make Markus the character to lead the charge for Android freedom. He's one who is treated incredibly well by his master/owner - there are some side interactions which see him attacked by protesters but it's possible to avoid this entirely - and the game even touches later on that his owner "was like a father to him", so the idea of him being the leader is one that I find quite confusing, especially when you have Kara, who is tortured, destroyed and attacked at various points throughout the game.

It does raise an interesting question about the gender roles in _Detroit_. Throughout the game we are told deviants are "software errors", that - although they have personalities - they are just programs, with no self-awareness or actual emotion. So, when they become deviant, why would Kara take on the role of a damsel in distress? It would be safe to assume that she has the same physical strength and attributes as other models of androids - so why force her into a gender stereotype? It seems that the stage is set for _her_ to take Markus' role. It's unusual because QD have clearly made a lot of effort in diversity of cast in terms of race of androids, which is a weird concept when you think about it anyway. Why do androids have race at all? Considering the venom that humans in _Detroit_ show to androids, would there be demand for non-white androids in a city that is apparently so completely intolerant?

Politics aside, the most interesting character by far is Connor. Connor is the only character with whom you have a choice of whether or not to become deviant, and his relationship with Lt. Anderson is entertaining, interesting and - at times - heartwarming. His gameplay mechanics are the most interesting with the ability to reconstruct past events, and his chapters provide a lot more lore and red herrings throughout.

__SPOILERS END__

All in all, _Detroit_ is an excellent game. It has some flaws, but you will be hard pressed to find a game that is so linear and yet at the same time offers so much freedom. When I reviewed _Heavy Rain_, I said it was probably not worth Â£40 - that's probably also true of _Detroit_, but it's considerably longer, and has considerably more paths, so it's a damn sight closer.

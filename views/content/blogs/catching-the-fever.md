# Catching the Fever

###### A return to form for emocore band Bullet For My Valentine

#### 26th April 2010

Let me start by saying that I was a massive fan of Bullet For My Valentine's first album, _The Poison_. They were the first band I went to see live and they were absolutely fantastic. Matt Tuck had a fantastic swagger about him that was both arrogant but somewhat likeable, and they had massive anthems such as _4 Words (To Choke Upon)_ that were truly fantastic.

And then there was _Scream Aim Fire_. Oh dear. This album almost destroyed what I thought of them, and the only thing that was going to draw me back to their third album was the fact that the reason _SAF_ was so appalling was that Tuck had allegedly contracted laryngitis and therefore could not sing properly anymore.

The first track I heard off of _Fever_ was _Begging For Mercy_, and I was afraid that maybe Bullet were destined to just become a shit band that happened to have one good album. Then one day, a friend told me about another song he had heard on Radio One called _Your Betrayal_ - and told me that it was more like the Bullet of old - and, thank god, he was right.

And so I waited with mixed feelings for the release of _Fever_.

The first three tracks (_Your Betrayal_, _Fever_, and _The Last Fight_) are big, bold, and brilliant. Then it progresses into the more ballad-style _A Place Where You Belong_, akin to an earlier single _All These Things I Hate_, only not as good. The album then blasts back with _Pleasure and Pain_, and while it still has the typical angsty-emo style lyrics (e.g. _"Embrace your apathy/You don't bring me pleasure/You just bring me pain"_) it has ripping, heavy riffs and a decent solo.

Then _Alone_ comes in. This riff sounds like it's inspired by As I Lay Dying's _Forsaken_, only it's got melodic lyrics instead of Tim Lambesis' growling vocals - and although they can't quite touch the lords of metalcore, it does a damn good job. It's even got a very good solo. This song is definitely the highlight of the album.

_Breaking Out, Breaking Down_ is average - it's not bad, but it's not the most interesting of songs to listen to. Then _Bittersweet Memories_ sounds like some kind of mainstream pop with metal elements - not to my taste. _Dignity_ is better, and wouldn't sound out of place on _The Poison_ or _Hand of Blood_.

_Begging For Mercy_ flashes past in a blaze of mediocrity before the album's outro, _Pretty On The Outside_ begins. This is a fitting end to the album, it's heavy, atmospheric and catchy, definitely ending the album on one of the better songs, and makes you feel very glad you listened to it (although I must say, it ends rather abruptly).

This album is a difficult one to review, as it has some very good highs, but then it's plagued by songs that sound like filler material. It's a massive, massive, massive leap from _Scream Aim Fire_, and the songs that are good are better than anything from _The Poison_.

In one way I look at it, I'm disappointed. But in another way, I think I'm being too picky. I mean, seven out of eleven songs are fantastic. And at the end of the day, they're the musicians, not me -

And Look At Them Now.

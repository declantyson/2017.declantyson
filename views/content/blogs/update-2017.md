# Two thousand and seventeen

###### A new start, a new look, a new stack

Hello, hello, hello.

Welcome to my completely, brand-spanking-new website. declantyson.net is no more. Welcome to *domain to go here*.
 
 Why did I drop declantyson.net? Well, a few reasons. The domain no longer made sense, as the new website is no longer built on .net. I have all of the work that I have painstakingly put into the Mynx CMS over the past six years backed up in [Github](http://github.com/mynxsoft/mynx), but it will no longer be a part of my personal website. The reason for this change is simple - my focus is no longer in ASP and so my website should reflect that.
 
 You are looking at a full-stack JavaScript application. I've actually dropped the CMS idea altogether, although it will eventually rear its ugly head later down the line. The thing is, Mynx was great as a tool for users to edit their content, but as a developer, I just want to write without any distractions, and I often want to embed silly little code snippets and custom templates, which was a lot of effort when you have to piss about with database structure. So, Mynx is no more, and instead I'm planning to rewrite the entire blog backlog in Markdown.
 
 "But you barely write blogs as it is! You're never going to write all of your blogs back in Markdown!" I hear you cry, woefully reminiscing of the time I told you all about the sausage baguette I was going to eat. Well, you're not wrong. The blog backlog is going to reduce dramatically. But, I'm hoping that my output in general will increase.
 
 Half of the reason I stopped writing so frequently was because I was unhappy with the method of input. Mynx was due an update and although I had started doing said update it was taking quite a long time, largely due to the fact that I rarely boot my Windows partition anymore - I use OS X at work, and Ubuntu at home. So, for efficiency's sake, I decided to rebuild the whole thing in a multiplatform environment that I work with every day - NodeJS.
 
 It works nicely, and as a developer I'm very happy with it. It's not something that I would give to a client to enter content in, but I don't have to. More importantly, I've kept the philosophy that I had with Mynx - fast, responsive and flexible - meaning that I have a base to build off in the future should I want to.
 
 On the front-end I've stuck to being as Vanilla as possible. There are no heavy frameworks, not even jQuery. I've tried to use some nice imagery, but I've tried to keep it minimal - one of the problems of the old site was the load times of all the thumbnails, which will probably come back in a lazy-loaded format later in life. I've implemented my own teeny-tiny PJAX library, [Ocelot](http://github.com/declantyson/ocelot), in an attempt to make this site fly.
 
 As time has gone on I've become progressively happier with my websites and this iterations is the cleanest yet. Time will tell how long it takes until I get bored of it, but if history is anything to go by, it'll be another 16 months. Who wants to bet how many more blogs I will write before then? There will be a prize of absolutely nothing for the winner.

 So, feel free to take a look around at the very minimal content there is here, and keep an eye out for updates in the coming months.

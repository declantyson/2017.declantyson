# House of Cards: The Future of Television?

###### Embracing the digital age of television

_WARNING: This is a complete, spoiler-filled review of House of Cards. If you don't want to know what happens, DON'T read ahead._

Not gonna lie - until about three days before Netflix was due to premier its second series of original programming, I had no idea that anything like House of Cards even existed. I saw it advertised on a bus stop close to work and thought to myself, 'Holy shit, my favourite actor* and director are doing a new TV series? AND IT'S ON IN THREE DAYS!?'

_*Author's note - I do not condone Spacey's actions in his personal life but I still respect his ability as an actor._ 

Because of the wonderful digital age that we live in I didn't waste a second in absorbing all of the information I needed to know. It's a remake of the 80's BBC miniseries, starring Kevin Spacey and produced by David Fincher - with some episodes directed by Fincher too. The series revolves around a US politician trying to get his way to the top of the food chain after being spurned for a role he was promised. There's plenty of affairs, drugs, scandals and a fair bit of evil - all masterminded by Frank Underwood, a politician who seems to be able to predict everybody's moves before they've made them.

After I finished watching the series (it took me a while for various reasons) I quickly glossed over a plot summary for the original series. It's much the same, except there's 6 or 7 hours worth of extra stuff in the US version, as you'd expect, because British television is always criminally short. The key concepts are all the same, though - obviously spoilers ahead here:

- Frank Underwood (main politician) is snubbed by the new government for a bigshot role (secretary of state, in this case);
- Underwood sleeps with Zowie Barnes (a reporter) to gain leverage over the media;
- Peter Russo (druggy-politician) is caught with hooker;
- Russo fucks everything up and Barnes reports it;
- Underwood kills Russo and makes it look like suicide;
- Underwood and Barnes have a tiff about something pathetic and she tries to bring him down;
- Underwood becomes VP.

Substitute the names and job titles with British ones and you've got yourself the core plot of the original series. Apparently at the end of the BBC ones Underwood's equivalent throws his reporter of the roof of the Houses of Parliament to keep her talking - badass - but nothing similar happens in the US drama. Instead, it appears in the final moments of the season that Zowie Barnes has the upper hand, as Underwood's right-hand man Stamper is trying in vain to warn him of *something* - who knows?! We'll have to see next year.

The series adopts an interesting storytelling style with Underwood frequently breaking the fourth wall to give the audience a monologue, using very sharp language, but often also very poetic, such as the killer line 'I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.' It's all very dramatic and makes for excellent television. In a broader sense, too, having such a well-known cast and crew helps to cement Netflix as a serious player in original programming in the near future, and the digital streaming format as a whole.

Is this format sustainable for the future, though? Well, yes, I think it is. In fact, it may soon threaten the very nature of television as we know it. Whilst the old fuddy-duddy in me likes the idea of scheduled programming so that I have a routine of what I watch when, the truth of the matter is it's so much more convenient to have all of the episodes at your fingertips immediately, whenever you want them. It's why we buy DVD's, right? So let's take up a little less space, and embrace the digital age.
